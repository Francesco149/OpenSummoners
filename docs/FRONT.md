  section, so STATUS can never drift from reality.  Update THIS when the active front
  moves; keep it a 60-second read.  Everything else in STATUS is derived from code.

- **Phase:** Phase 4–5 — porting the **in-game town backdrop** render path toward a trace
  that plays 1:1 pixel-perfect frame by frame on both sides. Milestone map: `ROADMAP.md`.
  Mechanical next chip: `port-frontier.md`.
- **Where we are (ckpt 70): the intro-PAN camera is WIRED LIVE — the town now pans.**
  `main.c game_render` steps a live `camera_view` each frame (`camera_follow_step` =
  `FUN_0043d1d0`, with the `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN(0x43d1d0)` flow-trace mirror) and projects the
  backdrop through its *current* scroll instead of the static const. `enter_game`
  spawn-snaps it (`camera_apply_snap` → cur=tgt=128000/12800); a hold timer fires the
  scripted pan (`camera_apply_pan` → tgt=12800/12800, speed 300) at hold-end. The two
  target-setters are bit-exact ports of `0x439690`'s SNAP/PAN command arms (`:599-664`),
  host-tested (clamp to `[0, map-vp]`; snap-jumps-cur / pan-keeps-cur). **Visually confirmed
  on the feed:** hold (cam x=128000) → mid-pan → settled (cam x=12800, town left edge).
  **848 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip** (+2). Also added `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2_SETTLED` (x=y=12800).
  **OPEN (PORT-DEBT `ingame-camera-pan`, synthetic stand-ins):** the pan TRIGGER timing
  (`GAME_CAMERA_HOLD_FRAMES=183` stands in for the unported `0x5a00c0` cutscene-script op
  that writes the command) + the easer step CADENCE (port steps per frame; retail per
  sim-tick → per-flip rate differs, so the pan isn't flip-anchored-exact mid-flight). The
  SETTLED end is a determinate camera both sides share → a flip-anchored full-frame diff is
  meaningful there now.
- **Methodology (reinforced ckpt 69):** "annotate" = the **flow-trace field spec**
  (`retail_fields.json` named functions+fields + port `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN` mirrors) — a CORE
  step of finishing any RE/port; thiscall/struct tagging is a SEPARATE static-readability
  lane. Never an ad-hoc symbol-rename. (CLAUDE.md "Annotate as you RE".)
- **Prior (ckpt 68): 24bpp parallax LUT grade LANDED — sky colour USER-CONFIRMED.**
  Found retail grades the 24bpp sky/mountain banks (`0x55`/`0x58`/`0x59`) at **DECODE**, not via
  the palette path (`0x417c40` early-exits to the plain getter when a bank has no palette): its
  **flag-3 branch** (the 24bpp case) stamps the slot's brightness descriptor (`f_08=1`, scales
  1000 = tint case 0, `f_18`=tone-curve LUT) before the getter, and the lazy `ar_sprite_decode`
  runs `ar_sheet_decode_pixels` (already ported, quirk #46). The port's parallax sink used the
  plain getter so never stamped it → sky decoded raw/too-bright. **Fix:** `game_arm_parallax_grade`
  in `main.c` replicates the stamp in `game_parallax_blit`. Verified: raw sky `(66,150,255)`→LUT
  →565 = `(33,125,239)`; **blue `239` matches retail's main sky band exactly**, and the user
  confirmed the grade looks correct on the feed. (The old finding's raw `(132,186,255)`/retail
  `(103,165,231)` numbers were wrong — actual raw is `(66,150,255)`.) **OPEN (deferred):** a
  "dark top gradient" the user sees in the establishing-scene frame (but not in settled gameplay)
  — likely a **per-scene CINEMATIC effect tied to the establishing shot**, to be confirmed by
  probing ground truth alongside the intro PAN RE.
- **Prior (ckpt 67):** backdrop TILES `differ_px==0` via the 8bpp palette grade (`color_grade.{c,h}`);
  the "establishing shot" proven a leftward **PAN not a zoom** (only `+0x60` moves; dx=0, same
  scale; `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2`). **840 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip.** Ledger **194/1490 touched /
  189 tested**. Both GUI builds clean.
- **NOT a full `differ_px==0` frame yet — named residuals** (NOT logic bugs): the **NPC actors**
  (present modes 0/1/2, blocked on the entity/spawn system — PORT-DEBT `present-actor-modes`); the
  **foreground tree** + **"Town of Tonkiness" banner** (`0x5a00c0`, PORT-DEBT `ingame-nontile-layers`);
  the intro **pan** is now wired but its TRIGGER timing + step CADENCE are synthetic (PORT-DEBT
  `ingame-camera-pan`), so the pan isn't flip-anchored-exact mid-flight — the **settled end**
  (`MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2_SETTLED`, x=y=12800) is where a flip-anchored sky diff is now meaningful.
- **Next move:** the camera is wired + pans (ckpt 70). The smallest next wins: (a) take a
  **flip-anchored full-frame backdrop/sky diff at the SETTLED end** (both sides share x=y=12800 —
  no cadence question) to confirm/close the sky `differ_px`; (b) the **foreground tree/banner**
  (`0x5a00c0` scripted-scene overlay player — also where the pan's cutscene-script TRIGGER lives,
  so RE'ing it closes both `ingame-nontile-layers` and the pan-trigger half of `ingame-camera-pan`);
  (c) the **actor renderers** (present modes 0/1/2, need the entity/spawn system first). The pan
  **cadence** (tick↔flip correlation) is a separate parity-refinement, validate via a live trace.
  Writeups: `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The camera is WIRED LIVE".
- **Tooling front:** **Phase-B B2 (the field-bearing flow trace) LANDED + live-verified**
  (`docs/plans/trace-tooling-phase-b.md`): `call_trace` carries `seq` + `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN/FIELD/END`;
  the Frida agent reads same-named retail fields per `tools/flow/retail_fields.json` (now incl.
  the `cam_*` camera chain + the ckpt-67 `tint`/`lutgate1/2`/`lut*` colour-grade probes +
  the ckpt-69 `camera_follow_step` producer entry);
  `tools/flow_diff.py` names the first `[chain]`/`[data]` divergence. Remaining Phase B: **B1**
  unified `scenario-test.py`, **B3** DDraw blit-command trace + `render_diff.py`.
  **`mem_watch.py` (ckpt 69):** now resolves **chain heap addresses**
  (`--watch-chain ROOTVA:HOPS:OFF:SIZE[:LABEL[:ARM_AT_FLIP]]`) + a **`--hw` hardware
  watchpoint** (frida-17 per-thread DR) — the fitting tool for a hot heap field (found the
  camera easer through its heap fn-pointer dispatch in one run).
- **Standing bar:** every divergence is `differ_px == 0` or a named/understood residual
  (`parity-ledger.md`); attribute to a pillar before suspecting logic
  (`parity-model.md`); seed-pinned both sides, compared by anchor/tick.
