<!--
  The ONE hand-edited status block.  tools/gen_port_ledger.py injects everything
  between the FRONT:BEGIN/END markers verbatim into docs/STATUS.md's "Current front"
  section, so STATUS can never drift from reality.  Update THIS when the active front
  moves; keep it a 60-second read.  Everything else in STATUS is derived from code.
  Port state / next-move detail belongs here or in HANDOFF.md, NOT in engine-quirks.md.
  Rolling per-checkpoint narrative → PROGRESS.md; deep RE → findings/.  Keep this SHORT.

- **2026-10-14 — rhost is THE porting loop; the MOVEMENT stack is ported and verified inside retail.**
  USER decisions (audit §7): deterministic cadence = rhost 1 update/flip; EN-old first (SE = a later
  delta layer); Frida retail drive RETIRED (legacy, don't extend). Port boot "Now Loading" frames now
  DEFAULT (`--no-boot-loading` = legacy axis; old port-timed traces keep working).
  Corpus: 7 scenarios incl. the USER's `rh-my-play` (15.7k flips: intro → house errands → town → shop;
  10 room loads). `rhost.py verify` (shadow, per call; full-state where a function writes widely):
  | function | VA | calls | div |
  |---|---|---:|---:|
  | tile movers | `0x54e990` / `0x54ded0` | 2.50M / 288k | 0 |
  | entity movers (actor scan) | `0x54e5c0` / `0x54db10` | 2.50M / 1.58M | 0 |
  | map decode (whole 2.9 MB grid) | `0x587e00` | 16 loads | 0 |
  | camera follow / shake | `0x43d1d0` / `0x43d340` | 21k / 42k | 0 |
  | character AI (input → cmd) | `0x478ba0` | 8,750 | 0 |
  | movement step (physics) | `0x467bb0` | 1.58M | 0 |
  | per-state clip + jump fx | `0x466930` | 977k | 0 |
  | the INTEGRATOR (dispatcher) | `0x442a70` | 1.03M (64k full-state) | 0 |
  | hazard probe | `0x440f40` | 31k | 0 |
  Hybrid gate: with all of the above REPLACING retail, every corpus scenario ends byte-identical.
  Infra: `src/world_layout.h` (retail-layout world/entity/char/body/cmd, pinned on 32-bit),
  `src/engine_calls.h` (slots → retail VAs for unported callees, PORT-DEBT(engine-call-slots)),
  `rh_shadow_ex` (full-state shadow; port code may call retail), `rng_bind`, heap zero-on-alloc
  (quirk #130), Windows binary `oss-rhost.exe` (openrecet kills `rhost.exe` by name).
- **Integrator `0x442a70` LANDED** (`src/char_integrate.c`): prologue, action start, poses 0x20/0x68..0x6a,
  the full per-type dispatch (~30 type handlers as slots), tail; special poses 0x75..0x81 delegated to
  retail (PORT-DEBT(integrate-special-poses); none occur in the corpus yet).
- **In flight — the NPC navigation AI `0x43f880`** (`src/npc_ai.c`, + `0x4412d0`, `0x441ae0`, …).
- **Next (port side):**
  1. verify the NPC AI `0x43f880`; then the apply pass `0x485fc0` and the tick driver `0x46cd70`
     (actor_update_all: `0x54f980`, `0x47b990`, `0x46e510`, `0x4710c0`) → the whole entity tick ported.
  2. SWITCH the port's freeroam drive onto the retail-layout world (`g_world`, wl_char bodies,
     `char_ai` → `char_integrate`) and retire the `character.c` reductions; prove it with
     `--det-clock` portshots/portstate vs rhost on `rh-my-play`.
  3. room transitions: the scene loop `0x59f2c0` (all 10 loads go through `0x59fe69`) +
     `load_room 0x586010`; the decode is already byte-exact.
  4. port-side DIK input (`--rh-trace` via the producer `0x46a880`, which is itself a shadow target).
- **Loop (per function):** read `decompiled-ida/enold/all_ida.c` (+ asm for conventions/widths) →
  port on world_layout types → wrapper in `tools/rhost/rh_hooks.c` → `rhost.py verify` + `corpus
  --check --hook replace:…` → commit with the evidence line. Coverage of a path: `--trap VA` counts.
