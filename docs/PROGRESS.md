## 2026-05-24 — Bootstrap (Phase 0)

Initial commit run.  Set up the project shape: nix flake with mingw-w64
i686 cross compiler + Ghidra + Frida-tools + Python (pillow/numpy/
sk-image/opencv/construct/rich/frida-python), `.editorconfig`,
`.gitignore`, MIT license, README.

`tools/setup.sh` — symlinks the user's Steam install of Fortune Summoners
into `vendor/original/`, detects Steam DRM by checking for a `.bind`
section in `sotes.exe`, runs Steamless via WSLInterop, and stashes the
unpacked binary in `vendor/unpacked/sotes.unpacked.exe`.  First run:
Steamless identified SteamStub Variant 2.1 and unpacked cleanly.
Original SHA: `7d779f2eb02b3c603857fedbc52be6973ac3b0b2c5c1bc696122ddac89fb9f1b`,
unpacked SHA: `9e032483b9981f73cabb83baca17a734fd9e7c41e114703900d9ee82c7969516`.

`tools/launcher/opensummoners-launcher.exe` — Job-Object supervisor copied
verbatim from OpenMare.  Guarantees no orphaned Windows-side .exes after a
SIGKILL'd WSL run.  Same `--timeout-ms` / `--grace-ms` / `--no-stdin-watch`
flags as the sibling.

`src/main.c` + `src/dev_hooks.c` — WinMain skeleton with the four
drop-in defaults the user asked for from day one:
  1. Auto-cd into `OPENSUMMONERS_GAME_DIR` + `SetDllDirectoryA` to the
     same, so any later `LoadLibrary` resolves game-dir DLLs first.
     `OPENSUMMONERS_GAME_DIR` is exported by the flake's shellHook with
     `WSLENV=…/p` so the .exe sees the Windows-form path.
  2. `user32!MessageBoxA/W` prologue patch that redirects every modal
     to stderr with a distinctive `[!!! REDIRECTED MESSAGEBOX !!!]`
     banner and auto-returns IDOK.  Override with `--show-msgbox`.
  3. Single-instance mutex (`OpenSummoners-SingleInstance`) catches
     stray .exes from previous SIGKILL'd runs.
  4. `--hide-window` / `--frames N` flags for harness/smoke runs.
Single-TU build (per the user's preference), two outputs:
`opensummoners.exe` (GUI subsystem) and `opensummoners-debug.exe`
(console subsystem, stderr surfaces in the launching shell).

`tools/ghidra-headless.sh` + `tools/ghidra-scripts/ExportDecompiledC.java`
— batch decompiles `vendor/unpacked/sotes.unpacked.exe` to
`docs/decompiled/` (gitignored).  Java post-script because nixpkgs'
Ghidra isn't built with PyGhidra.  First-run analysis kicked off in
background while we wrote the rest of Phase 0.

`tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js` + `tools/frida_capture.py` — Phase A
Frida harness.  Hooks:
  - `MessageBoxA/W` → redirect to `send({kind:"messagebox",...})` +
    auto-IDOK (mirrors the dev_hooks.c hook on the drop-in side).
  - `ShowWindow` / `ShowWindowAsync` / `SetWindowPos(SWP_SHOWWINDOW)`
    → force hidden for HWNDs we tracked from CreateWindowEx returns.
  - `PeekMessage*` / `GetMessage*` onLeave → tick a coarse frame counter.
  - `Sleep` → no-op (turbo).
  - `winmm!timeGetTime` → virtualised clock for the main thread only
    (turbo simulation speedup, not just loop-iteration speedup).
  - `waveOutSetVolume` → clamp 0 (silent audio).  DSound layer deferred
    to Phase B once Ghidra confirms the engine's COM init path.
All flags default ON per the user's instruction ("hidden window with
muted audio running in turbo mode as early as possible").

`tools/run-opensummoners.sh` + `tools/run-retail.sh` — single-source-of-
truth dev-loop recipes so the build / run / launcher / harness flags are
consistent every time.  No re-discovering gotchas per session.

Smoke verification:
  - `run-opensummoners.sh` end-to-end: launcher → debug.exe
    `--hide-window --frames 200` runs in ~3.2 s (16 ms × 200), MessageBox
    hooks both succeed (`@ 745d6e60` / `@ 745d7380`), init_game_dir cd's
    into the Windows-form game path, exit rc=0.
  - Retail smoke under Frida: green.  The frida-server.exe runs on the
    Windows host as `cutestation.soy:27042` (the host's LAN-resolvable
    name; WSL2 NAT doesn't loop back to 127.0.0.1).  Updated the flake's
    default + `frida_capture.py` to match — 127.0.0.1 was the wrong
    default the OpenMare sibling carried forward.

Discoveries (folded into agent code and findings docs as we hit them):
  - **sotes.exe is SteamStub Variant 2.1 packed.**  Spawning the
    on-disk exe outside the Steam process tree trips the DRM check
    (`Steam Error: Application load error P:0000065432`).  Fix:
    `tools/run-retail.sh` copies vendor/unpacked/sotes.unpacked.exe into
    the game dir as `sotes-unpacked-<pid>.exe` per run (needed alongside
    the engine DLLs so Windows DLL search finds sotesp/d/w).
  - **Frida 17.x API surface differs.**  `Module.findExportByName(modName,
    exp)` static method removed → use
    `Process.findModuleByName(name).findExportByName(exp)`.
    `Memory.readUtf8String(ptr)` removed → use `ptr.readUtf8String()`.
    Hooks attached while the process is suspended sit deferred until
    `Interceptor.flush()` — without that, all our installs no-op'd
    silently.  Use `Process.mainModule` instead of name-matching since
    the spawned exe is named per the temp filename.
  - **The engine launcher is a Win32 #32770 modal dialog**, NOT a
    `MessageBox`.  Created by `DialogBoxParamA(hInst, 0x2711, NULL,
    dlgProc=0x004013c0, 0)`.  The dialog manager bypasses public
    `CreateWindowEx` / `ShowWindow` / `SetWindowPos` exports.  We
    initially caught it via a periodic `EnumWindows` scan + force-hide,
    but the OS painted it before our 8 ms scan tick — a brief flash
    appeared on the user's desktop.

Final fix (silent boot achieved 2026-05-24):
  `installDialogBypass()` in `tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js`
  hooks `DialogBoxParamA` and replaces the engine's DLGPROC (arg 3)
  with a Frida `NativeCallback` wrapper.  On `WM_INITDIALOG`:
    1. Call original handler (loads saved settings into controls).
    2. Force-check Windowed Mode (ctrlId 10020) + Disable Sound
       (ctrlId 10024).
    3. `SendMessage(LaunchBtn, BM_CLICK)` synchronously — the engine's
       IDOK handler reads control state, persists, calls EndDialog.
    4. Return original result.
  Because `EndDialog` has been called before `WM_INITDIALOG` returns,
  the dialog manager skips its post-INITDIALOG ShowWindow step.  User
  confirmed "absolutely nothing" on screen.

Status of the harness:
  - Spawn retail headlessly under Frida → init agent → resume → engine
    boots silently through its launcher → reaches the main game window
    (`CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES`) within a few seconds → harness teardown
    via `device.kill(pid)`.
  - msg_ticks stays at 0 in the smoke summary — the engine reaches
    main window creation but doesn't enter its PeekMessage loop in 8 s.
    Probable additional bring-up phases (DirectDraw surface alloc,
    asset loader) gate the main loop; revisit when tracing the boot
    chain.

Ghidra batch decompile finished: 1768 functions written to
`docs/decompiled/` (gitignored).  First useful query already paid off
— `grep DialogBoxParam` immediately pointed at the dialog call site
and DLGPROC address.

Next session — Phase 1 priorities:
  1. Read DLGPROC at `0x004013c0` and its caller to understand
     `gl.cfg` (or wherever settings persist) layout.  This is the
     first thing the engine writes; spec it and we have an extractor.
  2. Find and document `WinMain` + the main loop + frame limiter
     (mirror OpenMare's `winmain-and-bootstrap.md`).
  3. Identify the DirectDraw 7 init path (`DirectDrawCreateEx` →
     `IDirectDraw7::SetCooperativeLevel` → primary surface alloc).
