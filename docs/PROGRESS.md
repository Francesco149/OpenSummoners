## 2026-05-24 — Bootstrap (Phase 0)

Initial commit run.  Set up the project shape: nix flake with mingw-w64
i686 cross compiler + Ghidra + Frida-tools + Python (pillow/numpy/
sk-image/opencv/construct/rich/frida-python), `.editorconfig`,
`.gitignore`, MIT license, README.

`tools/setup.sh` — symlinks the user's Steam install of Fortune Summoners
into `vendor/original/`, detects Steam DRM by checking for a `.bind`
section in `sotes.exe`, runs Steamless via WSLInterop, and stashes the
unpacked binary in `vendor/unpacked/sotes.unpacked.exe`.  First run:
Steamless identified SteamStub Variant 2.1 and unpacked cleanly.
Original SHA: `7d779f2eb02b3c603857fedbc52be6973ac3b0b2c5c1bc696122ddac89fb9f1b`,
unpacked SHA: `9e032483b9981f73cabb83baca17a734fd9e7c41e114703900d9ee82c7969516`.

`tools/launcher/opensummoners-launcher.exe` — Job-Object supervisor copied
verbatim from OpenMare.  Guarantees no orphaned Windows-side .exes after a
SIGKILL'd WSL run.  Same `--timeout-ms` / `--grace-ms` / `--no-stdin-watch`
flags as the sibling.

`src/main.c` + `src/dev_hooks.c` — WinMain skeleton with the four
drop-in defaults the user asked for from day one:
  1. Auto-cd into `OPENSUMMONERS_GAME_DIR` + `SetDllDirectoryA` to the
     same, so any later `LoadLibrary` resolves game-dir DLLs first.
     `OPENSUMMONERS_GAME_DIR` is exported by the flake's shellHook with
     `WSLENV=…/p` so the .exe sees the Windows-form path.
  2. `user32!MessageBoxA/W` prologue patch that redirects every modal
     to stderr with a distinctive `[!!! REDIRECTED MESSAGEBOX !!!]`
     banner and auto-returns IDOK.  Override with `--show-msgbox`.
  3. Single-instance mutex (`OpenSummoners-SingleInstance`) catches
     stray .exes from previous SIGKILL'd runs.
  4. `--hide-window` / `--frames N` flags for harness/smoke runs.
Single-TU build (per the user's preference), two outputs:
`opensummoners.exe` (GUI subsystem) and `opensummoners-debug.exe`
(console subsystem, stderr surfaces in the launching shell).

`tools/ghidra-headless.sh` + `tools/ghidra-scripts/ExportDecompiledC.java`
— batch decompiles `vendor/unpacked/sotes.unpacked.exe` to
`docs/decompiled/` (gitignored).  Java post-script because nixpkgs'
Ghidra isn't built with PyGhidra.  First-run analysis kicked off in
background while we wrote the rest of Phase 0.

`tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js` + `tools/frida_capture.py` — Phase A
Frida harness.  Hooks:
  - `MessageBoxA/W` → redirect to `send({kind:"messagebox",...})` +
    auto-IDOK (mirrors the dev_hooks.c hook on the drop-in side).
  - `ShowWindow` / `ShowWindowAsync` / `SetWindowPos(SWP_SHOWWINDOW)`
    → force hidden for HWNDs we tracked from CreateWindowEx returns.
  - `PeekMessage*` / `GetMessage*` onLeave → tick a coarse frame counter.
  - `Sleep` → no-op (turbo).
  - `winmm!timeGetTime` → virtualised clock for the main thread only
    (turbo simulation speedup, not just loop-iteration speedup).
  - `waveOutSetVolume` → clamp 0 (silent audio).  DSound layer deferred
    to Phase B once Ghidra confirms the engine's COM init path.
All flags default ON per the user's instruction ("hidden window with
muted audio running in turbo mode as early as possible").

`tools/run-opensummoners.sh` + `tools/run-retail.sh` — single-source-of-
truth dev-loop recipes so the build / run / launcher / harness flags are
consistent every time.  No re-discovering gotchas per session.

Smoke verification:
  - `run-opensummoners.sh` end-to-end: launcher → debug.exe
    `--hide-window --frames 200` runs in ~3.2 s (16 ms × 200), MessageBox
    hooks both succeed (`@ 745d6e60` / `@ 745d7380`), init_game_dir cd's
    into the Windows-form game path, exit rc=0.
  - retail smoke run pending — needs frida-server.exe started on the
    Windows side (UAC prompt).
