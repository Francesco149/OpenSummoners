## Port coverage (engine-proper functions of `sotes.exe`)

```
██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  12.3% touched   (12.3% host-tested, 13.5% of code bytes)
```

| status      | count | what it means                                          |
|-------------|------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| tested      |   192 | ported + module covered by the host unit suite       |
| ported      |     5 | reimplemented in src/, no host test for that module  |
| **touched** | **197** | tested + ported (FUN_ provenance ref in src/)    |
| unported    |  1561 | exists in engine, never referenced from src/         |

**Denominator note (read this before judging the %):** the headline % is over
**engine-proper** functions — the **1490** below
`0x5bdab0`. The other **268** non-thunk functions are the
statically-linked MSVC CRT tail (operator_new, _malloc, _strcmp, __ftol, the
`entry` startup, RtlUnwind, …); OpenSummoners is a **drop-in** that *links*
those like retail rather than porting them (PLAN.md §2-3), so counting them
would bury real progress. Full table is **1758** non-thunk
functions (of 1768 incl. thunks).

Code-byte coverage (13.5% of engine-proper bytes) is the truer progress
signal: the engine has a long tail of tiny leaf helpers, so function count
understates how much actual instruction volume is ported.

## Current front

- **Phase:** Phase 4–5 — porting the **in-game town backdrop** render path toward a trace
  that plays 1:1 pixel-perfect frame by frame on both sides. Milestone map: `ROADMAP.md`.
  Mechanical next chip: `port-frontier.md`.
- **Where we are (ckpt 69): the intro-PAN camera EASER located + ported bit-exact.**
  The establishing shot is a **scripted** leftward pan (NOT leader-follow): target x snaps
  to a fixed **12800** + speed **300** once at hold-end (~flip 1617), then the per-frame
  easer **`FUN_0043d1d0`** integrates current x toward it (`vel += 10/frame`, cap = speed
  300; snap+decelerate at target). Found via a **hardware watchpoint** on the view's heap
  `+0x60` (it's dispatched through a heap fn-pointer → invisible to static search; new
  `mem_watch.py --watch-chain … --hw`). Ported pure + host-tested **bit-exact vs the
  captured trajectory** (`src/camera_follow.{c,h}`, 6 tests; 846 pass/0 fail/6 skip).
  Annotated into the flow trace (`camera_follow_step` @0x43d1d0 + the view fields incl. the
  now-known `vel_x/vel_y` integrator). **OPEN (PORT-DEBT `ingame-camera-pan`):** wire the
  stepped camera into `game_drive` (live) + the scripted op that SETS tgt=12800/speed=300 at
  hold-end; then a flip-anchored full-frame backdrop/sky diff becomes possible.
- **Methodology (reinforced ckpt 69):** "annotate" = the **flow-trace field spec**
  (`retail_fields.json` named functions+fields + port `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN` mirrors) — a CORE
  step of finishing any RE/port; thiscall/struct tagging is a SEPARATE static-readability
  lane. Never an ad-hoc symbol-rename. (CLAUDE.md "Annotate as you RE".)
- **Prior (ckpt 68): 24bpp parallax LUT grade LANDED — sky colour USER-CONFIRMED.**
  Found retail grades the 24bpp sky/mountain banks (`0x55`/`0x58`/`0x59`) at **DECODE**, not via
  the palette path (`0x417c40` early-exits to the plain getter when a bank has no palette): its
  **flag-3 branch** (the 24bpp case) stamps the slot's brightness descriptor (`f_08=1`, scales
  1000 = tint case 0, `f_18`=tone-curve LUT) before the getter, and the lazy `ar_sprite_decode`
  runs `ar_sheet_decode_pixels` (already ported, quirk #46). The port's parallax sink used the
  plain getter so never stamped it → sky decoded raw/too-bright. **Fix:** `game_arm_parallax_grade`
  in `main.c` replicates the stamp in `game_parallax_blit`. Verified: raw sky `(66,150,255)`→LUT
  →565 = `(33,125,239)`; **blue `239` matches retail's main sky band exactly**, and the user
  confirmed the grade looks correct on the feed. (The old finding's raw `(132,186,255)`/retail
  `(103,165,231)` numbers were wrong — actual raw is `(66,150,255)`.) **OPEN (deferred):** a
  "dark top gradient" the user sees in the establishing-scene frame (but not in settled gameplay)
  — likely a **per-scene CINEMATIC effect tied to the establishing shot**, to be confirmed by
  probing ground truth alongside the intro PAN RE.
- **Prior (ckpt 67):** backdrop TILES `differ_px==0` via the 8bpp palette grade (`color_grade.{c,h}`);
  the "establishing shot" proven a leftward **PAN not a zoom** (only `+0x60` moves; dx=0, same
  scale; `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2`). **840 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip.** Ledger **194/1490 touched /
  189 tested**. Both GUI builds clean.
- **NOT a full `differ_px==0` frame yet — named residuals** (NOT logic bugs): the **NPC actors**
  (present modes 0/1/2, blocked on the entity/spawn system — PORT-DEBT `present-actor-modes`); the
  **foreground tree** + **"Town of Tonkiness" banner** (`0x5a00c0`, PORT-DEBT `ingame-nontile-layers`);
  the intro **pan** itself (`ingame-camera-snap`) — until it lands, port (gameplay cam) and retail
  (establishing-pan cam) sample different sky rows, so a true row-for-row sky diff isn't possible yet.
- **Next move:** the intro-pan easer is PORTED (ckpt 69); the remaining `ingame-camera-pan`
  work is (a) **wire** the stepped camera into `main.c game_render`/`game_drive` (replace the
  static `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2` with a `camera_view` stepped by `camera_follow_step` each
  frame) + (b) the **scripted op** that sets tgt=12800/speed=300 at hold-end (~183 flips after
  `game_enter`). Then a flip-anchored full-frame backdrop/sky diff is meaningful. After that:
  the **foreground tree/banner** (`0x5a00c0`) and the **actor renderers** (need the entity/spawn
  system first). Writeups: `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The camera EASER located".
- **Tooling front:** **Phase-B B2 (the field-bearing flow trace) LANDED + live-verified**
  (`docs/plans/trace-tooling-phase-b.md`): `call_trace` carries `seq` + `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN/FIELD/END`;
  the Frida agent reads same-named retail fields per `tools/flow/retail_fields.json` (now incl.
  the `cam_*` camera chain + the ckpt-67 `tint`/`lutgate1/2`/`lut*` colour-grade probes +
  the ckpt-69 `camera_follow_step` producer entry);
  `tools/flow_diff.py` names the first `[chain]`/`[data]` divergence. Remaining Phase B: **B1**
  unified `scenario-test.py`, **B3** DDraw blit-command trace + `render_diff.py`.
  **`mem_watch.py` (ckpt 69):** now resolves **chain heap addresses**
  (`--watch-chain ROOTVA:HOPS:OFF:SIZE[:LABEL[:ARM_AT_FLIP]]`) + a **`--hw` hardware
  watchpoint** (frida-17 per-thread DR) — the fitting tool for a hot heap field (found the
  camera easer through its heap fn-pointer dispatch in one run).
- **Standing bar:** every divergence is `differ_px == 0` or a named/understood residual
  (`parity-ledger.md`); attribute to a pillar before suspecting logic
  (`parity-model.md`); seed-pinned both sides, compared by anchor/tick.
