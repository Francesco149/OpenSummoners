## Port coverage (engine-proper functions of `sotes.exe`)

```
██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  12.5% touched   (12.5% host-tested, 13.5% of code bytes)
```

| status      | count | what it means                                          |

**Denominator note (read this before judging the %):** the headline % is over
**engine-proper** functions — the **1490** below
`0x5bdab0`. The other **268** non-thunk functions are the
statically-linked MSVC CRT tail (operator_new, _malloc, _strcmp, __ftol, the
`entry` startup, RtlUnwind, …); OpenSummoners is a **drop-in** that *links*
those like retail rather than porting them (PLAN.md §2-3), so counting them
would bury real progress. Full table is **1758** non-thunk
functions (of 1768 incl. thunks).

Code-byte coverage (13.5% of engine-proper bytes) is the truer progress
signal: the engine has a long tail of tiny leaf helpers, so function count
understates how much actual instruction volume is ported.

## Current front

- **Phase:** Phase 4–5 — porting the **in-game town backdrop** render path toward a trace
  that plays 1:1 pixel-perfect frame by frame on both sides. Milestone map: `ROADMAP.md`.
  Mechanical next chip: `port-frontier.md`.
- **LATEST (ckpt 81): the caravan's HORSES now TROT — the per-tick actor anim is wired +
  BIT-VERIFIED live.** Read `0x54f980` case-`0x1872d` (`:911-970`): its two halves are
  separable (quirk #82) — **`:911-928` is the frame-stepper, UNCONDITIONAL** (gated only on
  clip `+0x6c`, byte-identical to `anim_clip_advance`, reads no RNG/clock → the horses ALWAYS
  trot), and **`:929-970` is the behaviour**, which `break`s out unless primary AND the global
  scene-lock `*(0x8a9b50+0x27a8)==0`, then draws the LCG for idle/wander (the deferred RNG
  layer #77). So the trot is portable in isolation. PORTED: `actor_render_state` gains the anim
  block `timer`(+0x70)/`done`(+0x74); **`actor_anim_advance`** (a thin adapter to the single
  ported stepper `anim_clip_advance`); **`actor_pool_update`** = the `0x46cd70:123-169` band
  walk (advance every active render-state with a clip — static actors no-op); `main.c
  game_actor_update` runs it on the SAME sim-tick gate as the camera easer (`hold & 1`), BEFORE
  `camera_follow_step` (retail `0x439690` order :1108→:1123), with a `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN(0x46cd70)`
  mirror. **LIVE (port blit trace, settled cam 12800, one 144-Flip cycle):** the wagon is **3
  keyed cels res `0x3ec`** (corrects ckpt-80's mis-noted `0x058f`) at x160/288/416; the body
  cel (x416) steps **5→2→3→4→5** every 36 Flips while the two fixed cels hold frames 0/1;
  `0x46cd70` mirror reports `advanced:1`/tick. **USER-confirmed** (horses idle subtly — ear
  flicks; the wagon is PARKED, not moving — "which is how it's supposed to be"; so `WAGON_CLIP`
  is an IDLE loop, not locomotion — quirk #82). **896 pass** (+3); ledger 199/194 unchanged
  (bare-VA slices). quirk #82; PORT-DEBT `actor-protagonist-clip` narrowed to the RNG behaviour
  + the cutscene roll-in. `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The horses TROT". **NEXT (corrected
  ckpt 82):** the code-adjacent "siblings" `0x1872e`/`0x1872f`/`0x18730` are **OUT-OF-SCENE**
  — `0x1872e`←`0x539e80` room 410240 (area 410), `0x1872f`←`0x5034b0` room 230110 (area 230),
  `0x18730` = child of non-town char `0x11350`; the town script `0x4d7d80` spawns ONLY the
  wagon. Code-adjacency ≠ same scene (quirk #83). So the town frame's remaining DETERMINISTIC
  residual is the **foreground TREE + "Town of Tonkiness" BANNER** (`ingame-nontile-layers`,
  the non-actor half of the 36-blit residual; the rest is the deferred RNG NPC wander). Next
  chip = **pin the banner/tree producer empirically** from the blit-trace return addresses
  (the methodical loop that pinned the letterbox to `0x48c150`; the `0x5a00c0` overlay is only
  a hypothesis), then port. Also pending: byte-confirm the wagon via `render_diff` keyed on
  `(res 0x3ec, frame)` vs a panned-camera retail capture.
- **Prior (ckpt 80): the town intro `0x1872d` is PORTED + SPAWN-RE'd + WIRED + LIVE-VERIFIED —
  and it's the arrival WAGON, not "the protagonist" (corrects #79/#80).** Three parts: (1) **the
  render arm** — `actor_render_protagonist` ports `0x491ae0`'s case-`0x1872d` (a 3-cel composite;
  part 2 is byte-identical to `FUN_0044d160`/`actor_render_describe`, wrapped with two fixed
  bank-`0x175` cels @ x-256/x-128). (2) **the SPAWN, fully RE'd:** `0x1872d` is NOT a map object
  (code outside 70000) — it's spawned by the **town intro cutscene script `FUN_004d7d80`** (`case
  0x334be`=room 210110 / area `0xd2`, gated on event flags `0x5f76805`/`0x606aa4f`) →
  **`FUN_00431d10(0,0x1872d,anchor=0x65,x=0x3200,0,0)`** (the by-code `+0x11e0` spawn helper:
  free-slot scan + anchor-relative placement) → **`0x431e30` case-`0x1872d`** which installs sprite
  row 0 via **`FUN_00426db0(0,0x175,0,…)`** (the long-missing `+0x48` FILL PRIMITIVE, now RE'd —
  retires part of `actor-sprite-table`), clip `&DAT_00671c48`, layer 9, facing 99. (3) **WIRED +
  LIVE-VERIFIED:** `actor_spawn_protagonist` + the `game_actor_walk` dispatch → the port logs
  `8 nodes from 33 actors (bank 0x175 registered)`; a with-`0x1872d` vs no-`0x1872d` rebuild diff at
  the settled camera (cam 12800) **isolates exactly its pixels = a horse-drawn CARAVAN** (bbox
  x180-543), NOT a person → **`0x1872d` is the town intro arrival CARRIAGE** (**USER-CONFIRMED on the
  feed: "that definitely matches retail"**). The 3-cel composite = wagon-left | wagon-body |
  **HORSES**: the first render froze the body on frame 0 (redrew the wagon-left cel → "cut in half"),
  so decoded the clip **`&DAT_00671c48`** from the user's exe (`base_sprite 2, 4 frames, looping,
  delta {0,1,2,3}` → body cels 2..5 = the horses) and pointed the render-state at a reconstructed
  `WAGON_CLIP` → the body now draws sprite 2 = the horses. **893 pass** (+4); ledger 199/194 unchanged
  (bare-VA slices). quirk #81; PORT-DEBT `actor-protagonist-clip` (the horses are FROZEN on frame 2 —
  the per-tick stepper that trots them + the cutscene roll-in are deferred).
  `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The 0x1872d SPAWN + the arrival WAGON". **NEXT:** the per-tick anim
  (trot the horses) + the scripted roll-in; then the caravan's siblings `0x1872e`/`0x1872f` (likely
  the characters — spawned by `0x539e80`/`0x5034b0`); byte-confirm via `render_diff` (res `0x3ec` —
  ckpt 81 corrects the `0x058f` here from the live blit trace).
- **Prior (ckpt 79): the town CHARACTER band is RE'd, SPAWNED, RENDERED + WIRED — and it's
  mostly PROPS, not NPCs (USER-confirmed live).** Per the methodology ("capture each slot's
  `+0x48` live"), extended the `0x491ae0` field spec + captured every active `+0x11e0` actor at the
  town hold (flip 1480/1500/1520, `--seed-pin --lockstep`). **Census (corrects #78/#79):** of 33
  main-band actors, **27 are INVISIBLE** (all-zero `+0x48` → self-skip; collision/trigger/spawn
  volumes — the `0x111d6`/`0x112e6`/… physics-body codes), and **only 6 DRAW** — `0x1129e`×3 /
  `0x1129f` / `0x112e5` are **static PROPS** (bank `0x16c` = town-objects sheet res `0x403`: a
  barrel, the fountain — NOT people), + **`0x1872d` the animated protagonist** (bank `0x175`, the
  one PERSON; OUTSIDE the 70000 range = a SEPARATE spawn; needs the `0x491ae0` multi-part arm —
  **the bulk of the 36-blit residual**). Corrections landed: `0x426620` **ZEROES** `+0x48` (its
  `type*0x80+0x21c04` is the **collision-grid** lookup #79 misnamed); the sprite table fills
  **LAZILY** (`0x40afe0`/`0x41e600`, type-keyed def table, un-RE'd); and the prop offset from
  `map_x*100` is **DETERMINISTIC per-code (NOT RNG)** — the fountain `0x112e5` is `+0/+0` and
  matches retail exactly. **PORTED + WIRED + LIVE-VERIFIED:** `src/actor_spawn.{c,h}`
  (`actor_spawn_from_map`: 32 CHARACTER objects → `{actor,render-state}` at `(x,y)*100`, the 3
  prop rows from the captured stand-in, PORT-DEBT `actor-sprite-table`) + `town_render_step_ex`
  actor seam + `main.c` (`game_actor_walk` → `actor_render_static`, `game_cel_dims` cull,
  `game_present_blit` `PRESENT_KEYED` → `zdd_object_blt_keyed`). The port logs `5/32 actors
  emitted (bank 0x16c registered)` and the props render at the correct spots (USER-confirmed on
  the feed). **889 pass** (+6); ledger 199/194. quirk #80; `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The town
  actor RENDER CENSUS". **NEXT:** the `0x1872d` protagonist multi-part animated arm (the actual
  person + the bulk of the 36 residual) as its own arc; then `render_diff` vs retail flip 1500.
- **Prior (ckpt 78): the town actor SPAWN is RE'd + BYTE-VERIFIED — no live drive needed**
  (unblocks the ckpt-77 ported renderer; docs-only, 883 pass unchanged). **The chain**
  (corrects the ckpt-76 guess `0x42eb20`/"`0x587e00` layer pass"): `0x586010:698` →
  **`FUN_0058d460`** (room object-population pass) → **`FUN_00431e30`** (character activator).
  `0x58d460` walks the map's **86 object-placement layers** (`mapobj+0x38` headers, `+0x10`=type
  code, `+0x04/+0x08`=x/y) and dispatches each by **type RANGE** into four pre-alloc bands off
  `DAT_008a9b50` (EFFECT 50k→`+0x1160`, STRUCTURE 60k→`+0x2560`, **CHARACTER 70k→`+0x11e0` via
  `0x431e30`**, DEVICE 80k→`+0x13e0`; each a `"<kind> Object Count Over"`-guarded free-slot scan).
  `0x431e30` (thiscall, ECX=slot) per-type switch: `+0x1d0=1`/`+0x1d4=type`/`+0xfc=9`/`+0xe8=0`,
  zeroes `+0x48` sprite table, stores world (x,y); a helper (`0x426620`) installs the sprite from a
  def table (`type*0x80+0x21c04`). **The proof** (resolves "codes never assigned as constants"):
  the town codes ARE the map object type fields — `map_data.py --objects` on DATA 1022 → 15 effect
  + 39 structure + **32 character** + 0 device; the 32 char codes + multiplicities are IDENTICAL to
  the ckpt-76 live census (0x112e6 ×10, 0x111d6 ×7, …), with world positions. The 33rd live actor =
  the 1 animated NPC (`0x1872d`, separate path). `docs/proofs/map-object-layer-format.md`; quirk #79.
  **NEXT (the port):** the **code → `+0x48` sprite-table** mapping (the only datum not in the map —
  `0x431e30`'s def-table install; RE the 13 town codes OR capture each slot's `+0x48` live) → minimal
  spawn (32 objects from `map_data` → render-state pos + sprite + dir + layer 9) → wire into
  `game_render` → `render_diff` vs retail flip 1500 (the 36-blit residual drops) → human pixel-verify.
  `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The town actor SPAWN".
- **Prior (ckpt 77): the town ACTOR RENDER SIDE is PORTED + host-tested** (the default arm
  that draws 32/33 town actors), ahead of the spawn. Pure, no harness.
  **Ported (commit `0533603`):** `draw_pool_emit_actor` = `FUN_00492670` (the actor analog
  of `draw_pool_emit`; node mode = `bool(alpha!=0)`); **`actor_render.{c,h}` (NEW)** —
  `actor_render_describe` = `FUN_0044d160` (the static/animated/mirrored/angle sprite
  descriptor over the per-direction table `actor+0x48`) + `actor_render_static` = the
  `0x491ae0` **default arm** (`caseD_11257`: 32/33 town actors hit it); `map_present`
  **MODE 0** (the opaque-actor keyed path `FUN_005b9b70`, cull dims from the cel via a new
  `present_dims_fn`). actor + render-state are LOGICAL structs (the spawn fills them);
  `actor_sprite_row` (0x14) pinned. **Validated:** the render-state offsets match the ckpt-76
  live `0x491ae0` field spec exactly (`rs_x`/`rs_y`/`rs_clip`/`rs_frame` = +4/+8/+0x6c/+0x72);
  logic host-tested bit-exact. **883 pass** (+18); ledger 199/194. **NEXT (the gating arc —
  needs the harness, then the human for pixel-verify):** the **SPAWN** (the `+0x11e0` band
  activator — NOT `0x560e60`/`0x584710`; it's the entity subsystem `0x42eb20`/`0x4282f0`/…
  over the DATA 1022 layer entries) → the `0x1872d` animated arm (the 1 key NPC) → **wire**
  the band walk into `game_render` → `render_diff` vs retail flip 1500 (the 36-blit residual
  drops). PORT-DEBT `present-actor-modes` (narrowed: mode 0 done, wiring blocked on spawn) +
  `actor-occlusion`. `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The town ACTOR render side".
- **Prior (ckpt 76): the town NPC/actor RENDER PATH is RE'd LIVE + the trace tooling hardened.**
  User: "implement the NPCs / consult the runtime trace / harden + document the trace tooling."
  Did the RE + instrumentation half (render-side port follows). **Tooling:** added the reusable
  **`thischain`** field source (ECX-rooted pointer hops — probes any actor by its live `__thiscall`
  `this`) + **annotated** `0x491ae0` (actor render entry), `0x560e60`, `0x584710` in
  `retail_fields.json`. **RE (live, retail town hold flip 1500):** the MAIN actor band is
  `DAT_008a9b50+0x11e0` (0x80 slots, rendered by `0x491ae0`, updated by `0x54f980`; one of six
  bands `0x48c150`/`0x46cd70` walk). **33 active actors: 32 STATIC** (clip==0), **1 animated**
  (`0x1872d`). **32/33 behaviour codes fall through to `0x491ae0`'s DEFAULT arm → `FUN_0044d160`**
  (the static-actor descriptor) → `0x492670` emit into the draw_pool as **mode 0/1** (= the
  deferred PORT-DEBT `present-actor-modes`).  The code drives the AI (`0x54f980`), NOT the render —
  **one function draws the town**.  Render banks res `0x403`/`0x426`/… = the ckpt-75 36-divergence
  residual.  **Band is a PRE-ALLOCATED 128-slot pool** (`0x586010:487` `FUN_0058cf60(0x40)`×128);
  the per-room **spawn = ACTIVATE+configure**, running after `0x586010`'s `"Init Objects"` marker —
  a **data-driven entity-by-id** subsystem (codes never literal; NOT `0x560e60`=8 party / NOT
  `0x584710`).  **NEXT:** find the `+0x11e0` activator (hook post-"Init Objects"), then port the
  render side (`FUN_0044d160`+`0x492670`+present 0/1) + wire + pixel-verify vs retail flip 1500.
  865 pass (no C touched); engine-quirk #78; `findings/in-game-intro.md` "The town ACTORS".
- **Prior (ckpt 75): the establishing-shot cinematic LETTERBOX is PORTED + blit-trace 1:1.**
  RE'd the producer from the captured retail blit trace: it's NOT the `0x5a00c0` overlay but
  **`0x48c150:124-162`** (the per-frame world driver), two grid-fill loops that tile a 64×4
  opaque cel (res **`0x583`** = main-pool slot 41) across the screen — BOTTOM bar
  (`in_ECX+0x44` rows, ret `0x48c48a`, dy 416-476) then TOP bar (`in_ECX+0x48` rows, ret
  `0x48c4fe`, dy 0-60), both 64 → the quirk-#74 black bars (rows 0-63 + 416-479), 640×352
  cinematic window. **Ported `letterbox.{c,h}`** (the grid-fill, host-tested 4 + bit-exact
  vs the trace) + `main.c game_letterbox_blit` (resolves slot 41 frame 0, `zdd_object_blt_onto`,
  drawn after the present). **Re-diff: the town-frame divergences dropped 356→36** — all 320
  `0x583` blits now match retail on identity+geometry+state; the 36 left are exactly the
  deferred RNG-driven actor/banner/tree banks. **Port frame pixel-verified** (rows 0-63 +
  416-479 `(0,0,0)`, row 64 = sky), USER-CONFIRMED on the feed. 865 pass; parity-ledger #8;
  PORT-DEBT `ingame-letterbox` (the 64/64 heights stand in for the unported `0x5a00c0` op
  that writes `+0x44`/`+0x48` — the geometry is bit-exact). **Next chip: the "Town of
  Tonkiness" BANNER + foreground TREE (`0x5a00c0` overlay player).**
- **Where we are (ckpt 73): the actor-band residual is PINNED to the RNG pillar — and the
  shared LCG stream is NON-DETERMINISTIC run-to-run EVEN UNDER `--seed-pin`.** Ran the ckpt-72
  directed live check: drove retail **twice** (`--seed-pin --lockstep --no-turbo`, same
  in-game trace), snapshotting the LCG state `DAT_008a4f94` at the per-sim-tick actor-update
  boundary (`0x46cd70`, new `rng` field). **Result: `rng` matches 0/8643 in-game
  sim-ticks** — the stream is at a different phase every tick despite the pinned seed and the
  deterministic sim-tick index. **Smoking gun:** at `prologue_enter` BOTH runs are on the
  IDENTICAL flip 946 yet rng differs (`0x84654e6f` vs `0xa79a2d6e`) → at the same flip the
  engine has drawn a *different number* of LCG values. Mechanism: a consumer draws per-PRESENT
  and the presents-per-sim-tick count is non-deterministic (quirk #75), so the stream phase
  desyncs and never re-converges. Since `0x54f980`'s behaviour cases draw this exact LCG
  (`FUN_005bf505`, ~40 sites: idle waits `+0x5c`, the idle→wander branch pick, move offsets →
  `0x450ef0`), the actors pick different waits/dirs/positions run-to-run = the #75 ~6.7k-px
  band. **CONCLUSION:** an RNG-reading subsystem needs its OWN **RNG anchor** (snapshot/restore
  `DAT_008a4f94` at the game_enter sim-tick, both sides) — the camera's `g_sim_tick` anchor is
  insufficient for it (works only because the camera reads no RNG). Parity bar for the actor
  band = "data-1:1 given a matched RNG state" (retail-vs-retail isn't observed-1:1 here).
  (The `a0_clip/a0_frame` fields matched 8643/8643 but TRIVIALLY — main-band slot 0 was inert
  the whole run; the `rng` divergence is the real result.) Tool: `tools/rng_tick_diff.py`.
  Engine-quirk #77; `in-game-intro.md`. **DIRECTION (user): defer ALL RNG-order parity**
  until every in-scene RNG consumer is RE'd, then match consumption order (rng+`rngcalls`
  both sides — the flow trace now carries `rngcalls`, the unified consumption signal,
  openrecet-style; commit `4c587c0`). **Next chips = implement the scene's VISUAL elements**
  (LETTERBOX #74 → `0x5a00c0` banner/tree → NPC render/spawn); RNG behaviour parity comes after.
- **TOWN FRAME DIFFED via the new blit trace (ckpt 74) — the port's backdrop is PIXEL-FAITHFUL;
  the gaps are MISSING layers, pinpointed.** render_diff (hold: port 1200 ↔ retail 1500, both
  cam=128000) → 606 retail / 250 port blits, **356 divergences ALL `[sprite]` (missing), ZERO
  `[rect]`/`[decode]`/`[state]`, ZERO port-extra** — every port blit matched retail on identity
  + geometry + state. The missing draws: **320× bank `0x583`** (a 64×4 full-screen grid, frame 0,
  deterministic, `dy=416` = the letterbox row → the **establishing-shot cinematic overlay**,
  quirk #74 — **PORTED ckpt 75, see LATEST above; the 320 blits now match retail**) + ~36 actor/overlay banks
  (`0x426`/`0x403`/… NPCs + tree + banner — RNG-driven, accepted-divergent until the scene RNG is
  RE'd). `findings/ddraw-blit-trace.md` "The TOWN frame".
- **Prior (ckpt 72): the ACTOR ANIMATION cycle RE'd + the frame-stepper ported — rides the
  sim-tick clock, no separate counter.** The per-tick UPDATE pass (`0x439690:1108`→`0x46cd70`
  once/tick→`0x54f980` per actor) runs one byte-identical inline stepper on the render-state
  anim fields (`+0x6c` clip/`+0x70` timer/`+0x72` frame/`+0x74` done): `timer++`; at `>=clip.dur`
  → `frame++`,`timer=0`; at `>=clip.count` → loop or one-shot hold. Clip = a fixed **0x154-B
  32-frame** descriptor, (re)set on STATE CHANGE (`0x40afe0`/`0x41e600`). **PORTED (host-tested
  bit-exact, 854 pass): `src/anim_clip.{c,h}`.** The stepper reads no GetTickCount/Flip/RNG → it
  is deterministic under the camera's `g_sim_tick` anchor; ckpt 73 then proved the leftover band
  diff is the RNG-driven BEHAVIOUR, not the stepper. Engine-quirk #76.
- **Prior (ckpt 71): TIMESTEP DETERMINISM established — the SIM-TICK is the only
  valid frame-of-reference; the "house off by 3px" was FLIP-misalignment, not a bug.**
  The in-game sim is a wall-clock GetTickCount frame-limiter (`FUN_00439690:776-859`): one
  logical sim tick per outer iteration (easer `0x43d1d0` once at `:1123`) but a VARIABLE
  number of Flips per tick → **the Flip index is non-deterministic run-to-run** (two identical
  retail runs disagree on 47-86% of flips by ≤3px; `--lockstep-epsilon-ms 0` is worse, so it's
  intrinsic, not the epsilon). The **sim-tick index** (easer-call count) is bit-identical.
  The user's whole-foreground 3px trail (background Δ0) is the signature of flip-misalignment
  — the 0.5×/0.25× parallax hides the same camera offset the 1× foreground exposes; the tile
  math is provably identical at equal `cam_x60`. **FIX (committed):** the agent counts easer
  calls (`g_sim_tick`), tags every captured frame (`frame_<flip>_t<simtick>.png` + manifest)
  + call-trace event, and RESETS the counter at the `game_enter` scene-load anchor (synchronize
  at every non-deterministic load) → cross-run deterministic (99 ticks, 0 cam-mismatches; pan
  starts at tick 92 both runs). `tools/sim_tick_diff.py` matches two run-dirs by sim_tick/cam
  (dx=0) vs flip (the 3px trail). Engine-quirk #75; `in-game-intro.md` "Timestep determinism".
  **DECISION (user):** anchor each subsystem for determinism rather than a global timestep
  hack (fallback if it gets unwieldy). The camera is synced (sim-tick); the actor anim cycle is
  now RE'd + ported (ckpt 72 above — it rides the same sim-tick clock, no new pin needed). The
  intra-tick-identical observation is now explained: the stepper reads no flip/clock/RNG.
  Standing rule: never diff on the Flip index — anchor on the sim tick. NB `--turbo` is NOT faster in-game (Frida/LAN overhead dominates, not Sleep) and
  breaks the no-turbo-timed input traces; use `--no-turbo --lockstep` until traces are re-timed.
- **Prior (ckpt 70): the intro-PAN camera is WIRED LIVE — the town now pans.**
  `main.c game_render` steps a live `camera_view` each frame (`camera_follow_step` =
  `FUN_0043d1d0`, with the `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN(0x43d1d0)` flow-trace mirror) and projects the
  backdrop through its *current* scroll instead of the static const. `enter_game`
  spawn-snaps it (`camera_apply_snap` → cur=tgt=128000/12800); a hold timer fires the
  scripted pan (`camera_apply_pan` → tgt=12800/12800, speed 300) at hold-end. The two
  target-setters are bit-exact ports of `0x439690`'s SNAP/PAN command arms (`:599-664`),
  host-tested (clamp to `[0, map-vp]`; snap-jumps-cur / pan-keeps-cur). **Visually confirmed
  on the feed:** hold (cam x=128000) → mid-pan → settled (cam x=12800, town left edge).
  **848 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip** (+2). Also added `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2_SETTLED` (x=y=12800).
- **CADENCE + TRIGGER measured → the pan is now TRAJECTORY-1:1 (ckpt 70b).** A retail
  field-spec trace (`--seed-pin --lockstep --no-turbo`, easer `0x43d1d0` + Flip hooked,
  contiguous Flip whitelist) pinned both stand-ins to ground truth: the easer fires **once
  per 2 Flips** (the sim runs at half the Flip rate; `cam_x60` is a STEP function, −300/2flips
  at cruise) and the pan command fires at **`game_enter + 184` Flips** (Flip 1616 HOLD, 1617
  PAN). `game_camera_step` now gates the sim to every 2nd frame (`hold & 1`), trigger at
  `GAME_CAMERA_HOLD_FRAMES=184`. **The port now passes through the IDENTICAL `cam_x60`
  sequence as retail** (128000,127990,127970,127940,…,cruise −300/2flips — verified by
  diffing the captured `0x43d1d0` mirror). **RESIDUAL (PORT-DEBT `ingame-camera-pan`):** a
  ~2-3 Flip startup-jitter PHASE offset (retail's sim accumulator is wall-clock-paced — a
  4-Flip plateau at 1618-1621 a clean 2:1 step can't reproduce; ≤1 step ≈ 3px, transient,
  zero at hold+settled) + the cutscene-script TRIGGER source — both downstream of the
  in-game sim / `0x5a00c0` port.
- **Methodology (reinforced ckpt 69):** "annotate" = the **flow-trace field spec**
  (`retail_fields.json` named functions+fields + port `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN` mirrors) — a CORE
  step of finishing any RE/port; thiscall/struct tagging is a SEPARATE static-readability
  lane. Never an ad-hoc symbol-rename. (CLAUDE.md "Annotate as you RE".)
- **Prior (ckpt 68): 24bpp parallax LUT grade LANDED — sky colour USER-CONFIRMED.**
  Found retail grades the 24bpp sky/mountain banks (`0x55`/`0x58`/`0x59`) at **DECODE**, not via
  the palette path (`0x417c40` early-exits to the plain getter when a bank has no palette): its
  **flag-3 branch** (the 24bpp case) stamps the slot's brightness descriptor (`f_08=1`, scales
  1000 = tint case 0, `f_18`=tone-curve LUT) before the getter, and the lazy `ar_sprite_decode`
  runs `ar_sheet_decode_pixels` (already ported, quirk #46). The port's parallax sink used the
  plain getter so never stamped it → sky decoded raw/too-bright. **Fix:** `game_arm_parallax_grade`
  in `main.c` replicates the stamp in `game_parallax_blit`. Verified: raw sky `(66,150,255)`→LUT
  →565 = `(33,125,239)`; **blue `239` matches retail's main sky band exactly**, and the user
  confirmed the grade looks correct on the feed. (The old finding's raw `(132,186,255)`/retail
  `(103,165,231)` numbers were wrong — actual raw is `(66,150,255)`.) **OPEN (deferred):** a
  "dark top gradient" the user sees in the establishing-scene frame (but not in settled gameplay)
  — likely a **per-scene CINEMATIC effect tied to the establishing shot**, to be confirmed by
  probing ground truth alongside the intro PAN RE.
- **Prior (ckpt 67):** backdrop TILES `differ_px==0` via the 8bpp palette grade (`color_grade.{c,h}`);
  the "establishing shot" proven a leftward **PAN not a zoom** (only `+0x60` moves; dx=0, same
  scale; `MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2`). **840 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip.** Ledger **194/1490 touched /
  189 tested**. Both GUI builds clean.
- **NOT a full `differ_px==0` frame yet — named residuals** (NOT logic bugs): the **NPC actors**
  (present modes 0/1/2, blocked on the entity/spawn system — PORT-DEBT `present-actor-modes`); the
  **foreground tree** + **"Town of Tonkiness" banner** (`0x5a00c0`, PORT-DEBT `ingame-nontile-layers`);
  the intro **pan** is wired + cadence/trigger-matched (ckpt 70b) — it passes through retail's
  exact `cam_x60` sequence; residual is a ~2-3 Flip startup-jitter PHASE (PORT-DEBT
  `ingame-camera-pan`), zero at the hold + settled ends (`MAP_RENDER_CAM_TOWN_3F2_SETTLED`, x=y=12800).
- **PAN BACKDROP DIFF DONE — verified pixel-1:1 (ckpt 70b).** Captured fresh retail pan frames
  (`--no-turbo --seed-pin --lockstep`) + their `cam_x60`, matched port frames by `cam_x60` (port
  Flips 1304/1344/1384/1422/1462 ↔ retail 1617/1660/1700/1740/1780, shared cam 127990/125690/
  120050/114350/108350), and diffed: the **backdrop is Δ0** (shift-search peaks sharply at
  `dx=dy=0`; pan-start `x=80` column all Δ0). The remaining diff is the **named missing layers
  ONLY** — exactly the signal we wanted. NEW retail ground-truth (quirk #74): the establishing
  shot is **LETTERBOXED** (solid-black bars rows 0-63 + 416-479, a 640×352 cinematic window; the
  "dark top" the user saw, with a matching bottom bar). Parity-ledger entry #7.
- **Next move (the named layers, simplest first):** (a) the **cinematic LETTERBOX** (quirk #74)
  — **DONE ckpt 75** (`letterbox.{c,h}`, the `0x48c150:124-162` grid-fill; 356→36 diff); (b) the **"Town of Tonkiness" banner** + **foreground tree/veg**
  (`0x5a00c0` scripted-scene overlay player — also where the pan TRIGGER source lives, closing
  `ingame-nontile-layers` + the trigger half of `ingame-camera-pan`); (c) the **actor renderers**
  (present modes 0/1/2, need the entity/spawn system first). Writeups: `findings/in-game-intro.md`
  "The pan CADENCE + TRIGGER measured" + the diff verification; quirk #74.
- **Tooling front (ckpt 74): the DDraw BLIT TRACE landed + cross-side-verified — we now have
  the two-drill-in coverage the user asked for.** `render_diff` names the wrong DRAW (and how:
  `[sprite]`/`[decode]`/`[rect]`/`[state]`); `flow_diff` names the wrong LOGIC. B3 (`docs/plans/
  trace-tooling-phase-b.md`, `findings/ddraw-blit-trace.md`): `src/render_id.{c,h}` is the
  cross-side identity — a cel→`(resource_id, frame)` registry (openrecet's `tex_name` trick:
  drop the alloc-dependent pointer, key on the load-stable asset name) **plus `dhash`**, an
  FNV-1a fingerprint of the DECODED sheet pixels (the improvement over openrecet's name-only
  scheme — a software blitter has the pixels in CPU mem at decode, so it catches RIGHT sprite /
  WRONG decode, the palette/24bpp residual class). Port emits at the 5 blit primitives
  (`zdd_emit_blit`); the Frida agent mirrors it (resolver `0x418470` registry + the new
  `renderid`/`thisderef` field sources, each auto-installing — no ad-hoc flag). **LIVE-VERIFIED:**
  retail emits the IDENTICAL `resource_id` (0x91b) as the port for the title background; ECX/arg
  reads correct; render_diff named all 59 title-phase blits by identity. Next layers: retail-side
  decode-hash (so `[decode]` fires cross-side), the cdecl `0x5bd550` retail spec, a same-scene
  aligned in-game diff. AGENT-WORKFLOW.md trimmed to subagent-only (process audit). 813 pass.
- **Prior tooling: Phase-B B2 (the field-bearing flow trace) LANDED + live-verified**
  (`docs/plans/trace-tooling-phase-b.md`): `call_trace` carries `seq` + `CALL_TRACE_BEGIN/FIELD/END`;
  the Frida agent reads same-named retail fields per `tools/flow/retail_fields.json` (now incl.
  the `cam_*` camera chain + the ckpt-67 `tint`/`lutgate1/2`/`lut*` colour-grade probes +
  the ckpt-69 `camera_follow_step` producer entry);
  `tools/flow_diff.py` names the first `[chain]`/`[data]` divergence. Remaining Phase B: **B1**
  unified `scenario-test.py`, **B3** DDraw blit-command trace + `render_diff.py`.
  **`mem_watch.py` (ckpt 69):** now resolves **chain heap addresses**
  (`--watch-chain ROOTVA:HOPS:OFF:SIZE[:LABEL[:ARM_AT_FLIP]]`) + a **`--hw` hardware
  watchpoint** (frida-17 per-thread DR) — the fitting tool for a hot heap field (found the
  camera easer through its heap fn-pointer dispatch in one run).
- **Standing bar:** every divergence is `differ_px == 0` or a named/understood residual
  (`parity-ledger.md`); attribute to a pillar before suspecting logic
  (`parity-model.md`); seed-pinned both sides, compared by anchor/tick.
