# Session handoff — last updated 2026-06-03 (ckpt 52 — GAME_DRIVE SCAFFOLD stood up (plan 3b's first bullet).  `enter_game` no longer re-displays the title — it stands up a new `game_drive` (`src/game_drive.{c,h}`, the milestone-2 counterpart of prologue_drive): owns the in-game input ring, and `main_loop_body` runs one `game_drive_step` per presented frame.  The in-game ENGINE (0x59f2c0 setup + 0x586010 sim + 0x5a00c0 render) is still unported, so a step renders the faithful BLACK map-load frame (`game_render`=zdd_object_clear) — the state retail shows from game_enter (~flip 1092) to the first town frame (~1150) while the engine loads the map + fades (golden flips 900-1100 black).  VERIFIED LIVE (trace-port, --frames 1300): game_enter@1116 rng 0x40d00581 (matches retail @1092); port runs game_drive to 1300 without re-displaying title; captures frame 400 (title phase6)=full content, frames 1160/1200 (in-game phase=-1)=fully black → early in-game frames now match retail's black entry.  3 host tests (test_game_drive.c) → 753 pass.  Ledger 175/1490 unchanged (scaffold/seam, no new FUN).  Also recorded: EXE-NULL banks 0x570-0x572 CONFIRMED present in sotes.unpacked.exe .rsrc (type=DATA); port must load via LoadLibraryExA(sotes.exe,AS_DATAFILE) not settings=NULL; their registration stays coupled to the engine-time slot indices (deferred with 0x5a00c0).  NEXT: port a slice of 0x5a00c0 into game_render for the static town backdrop — needs the world populated by 0x59f2c0 setup + 0x586010 sim first (the 0x4120 map object, 0x5400c/0x7808 buffers, &DAT_006940c8 registry).  Clean /clear point.)

# Session handoff — earlier (ckpt 51 — PLAN 3a RESOLVED: the in-game town's resource banks are identified by a NEW live res-probe (`frida_capture.py --res-probe` → hooks `bs_decode_resource` 0x5b7800, logs every distinct (DLL,id,type) load).

**This is the first thing to read at the start of every session.**

Rolling state — REWRITE on each meaningful checkpoint. `docs/PROGRESS.md` is the
append-only changelog; this file is "where to pick up *right now*".

## ⭐ Current state (ckpt 52): title bit-exact loop; new-game scene bit-exact (box/text/cursor/tooltip + picker); prologue gem cutscene content bit-exact (63/64) + the fade-out timing ported. Milestone 1 (title+new-game+prologue) is 1:1 for rendered content. **Milestone 2 (the game proper) IN PROGRESS**: the in-game seam is wired + anchored (game_enter, both sides, rng-matched), the engine 0x59f2c0 is surveyed/decomposed, **plan 3a is RESOLVED** (town banks identified + boot batches g2/g3/g5 wired, title differ_px=0), and **the `game_drive` scaffold is stood up** (ckpt 52 — `src/game_drive.{c,h}`, wired into enter_game/main_loop_body, renders the faithful black map-load frame; the early in-game frames now match retail's black entry window). The engine 0x59f2c0 + children (0x586010 sim, 0x5a00c0 render) remain UNPORTED (plan 3b — the multi-checkpoint body; see Next move #1 / docs/findings/in-game-intro.md). Deferred: the EXE-NULL town banks 0x570-0x572 (confirmed in sotes.exe .rsrc; port loads via LoadLibraryExA(sotes.exe,AS_DATAFILE); registration coupled to engine-time slot indices, plan 3b); the fade-out frames' RENDER (box-alpha arm, Next move #2).

The **new-game config scene** is live + interactive (ckpt 39) AND now renders the
**bordered cream box panel** behind the menu (ckpt 40).  `newgame_render`
(`main.c`) composes the frame retail-style: clear primary → draw the two 9-slice
box panels via DDraw (**menu box (32,32)400×124** + **tooltip box (32,392)576×80**)
→ GetDC + `glyph_grid_render` the menu text on top (base (32,32), Courier New
7×18 = font slot 5).  The 9-slice render is the pure, host-tested
**`src/newgame_box.{c,h}`** (port of `0x48cf80`'s opaque arm, quirk #67): a tiling
walk over a `newgame_box_ops` vtable, bank **PE resource 0x457** (=
`AR_SPR_FONT_TEX_457`, already registered by `ar_register_fonts`, 32×32 cells,
frames tl0/top1/tr2/l3/c4/r5/bl6/b7/br8, center = cream RGB(239,227,214)); the
real blit (`ar_sprite_slot_frame` + `zdd_object_blt_clipped` = `FUN_005b9bf0`) is
the main.c adapter.

The scene composes from the already-ported builder (`newgame_menu.c`, ckpt 37),
text renderer (`glyph_render.c`, bit-exact ckpt 36), run-loop model
(`newgame_scene.c`, ckpt 38), drive (`newgame_drive.c`, ckpt 39, quirk #66), and
now the box (`newgame_box.c`, ckpt 40).  **Verified LIVE** (port frame 760): menu
box **differ_px 307/50800 (0.6%)** vs the golden, with **all 307 residual pixels
in the top-left corner** = the **deferred animated sparkle overlay** (`0x48d940`,
bank **0x3e8**, frames 16–19, at (44,29)); the 9-slice panel + menu text are
**bit-exact everywhere else**.

What's left for the scene is the **remaining chrome + transitions**: the sparkle
corner (`0x3e8`), the tooltip TEXT node (y=416/444, word-wrapped — box drawn, text
computed by `newgame_scene_tooltip`, needs the word-wrap split), the option
picker submenu (`0x567ba0` — a kind-0 confirm yields NEWGAME_OPEN_PICKER, surfaced
but inert), the box fade-in (`0x48cf80`'s alpha arm), and the Start→game path (the
Elemental-Stone intro `0x564160`→`0x5642e0`→`0x59ec30`).  See **Next move #1**.

The title is feature-complete as a *loop*: intro bit-exact, menu interactive
(ckpt 32), and now the menu-commit return code is **dispatched** like retail's
boot driver instead of force-quitting (ckpt 33, `src/app_flow.c` +
`reenter_title`/`build_title_drive` in `main.c`). **Exit (8) → clean shutdown;
every other commit → the sub-scene (all UNPORTED stubs for now) → re-display the
title** (which replays the intro from phase 0, faithful — quirk #60). The
sub-scenes themselves do not render yet; that's the next rock (glyph/text
pipeline — see Next move).

The whole intro chain is bit-exact, AND the menu responds to input: injected
`--input-trace` nav moves the cursor (both directions) and confirm returns the
selected row's action code (ckpt 32: `FUN_0056c930`'s mode-1 `+0x54` ramp,
`menu_owner_transition_step`, wired as `post_update`, quirk #59). Use
`--menu-trace` to log cursor-row changes. **The intro render chain:**

```
title_scene_step → title_sink → resolve_frame(bank 19/20)
   → ar_sprite_slot_frame(slot, id)
        → ar_sprite_decode (0x4184a0)  [NOW FIRES — banks registered]
             → bs_decode_resource(sotesd.dll, 0x91b, "DATA", compressed)
             → ar_sprite_slice (0x4188b0): trim + format switch + build
                  → ar_sheet_format_hook → bs_convert_to_16bpp (RGB565)
                  → ar_frame_build_hook → zdd_object_new_cell (8d) → real surface
        → title_draw_sprite → keyed blit onto primary → present → VISIBLE
```

**Verified BIT-EXACT** (`differ_px==0`) against retail goldens for: the title
menu + selected-row cursor (R1, parity-ledger #1, ckpt 28); the **studio logo**
(phase 0, fade 640, #2) and **title-art logo** (phase 3, fade 820, #3) — both
ckpt 30, **user-confirmed 1:1**; the **phase-7 subtitle-reveal sweep** at full
reveal; and (ckpt 31) the **phase-7 particle twinkles** (#4, port Flip 465 vs
`sparkle-align/frame_00939`, seed-pinned `0x4f5347`, **user-confirmed 1:1 incl.
particles**). **Intro pacing (R3) is correct** (ckpt 29): every fade tick
renders at ~60 Hz, wall-clock to menu matches retail (~9.2 s).

**parity-ledger R4 is CLOSED (ckpt 31).** The intro has **no known content
divergence left**. The only non-bit-exact thing about the intro is the
**flip-INDEX** at which a given state renders (R3 render-rate ~2.2× + run-to-run
intro-pacing jitter) — which is **not portably reproducible by design** and not
chased; the distinct-content sequence + every random-particle frame match at
tick alignment. Seed pinning (`OSS_RNG_DEFAULT_SEED 0x4f5347` port-side,
`--seed-pin` harness-side, default ON) is what makes the RNG-driven twinkles
comparable; align frames by the `subtitle_anim_start` anchor + update-tick.

## R3 is resolved — what "pacing" did and didn't mean (read before re-opening)

The port's *wall-clock* pacing already matched retail; the Flip-INDEX gap is a
render-rate artifact (retail ~127 flips/s duplicating each state ~2.2×; the port
now renders each state once at ~60 Hz). **Flip-index-exact** match to a specific
golden = the capture rig's refresh and is **not portably reproducible** — do not
chase it. The achievable, meaningful target is the *distinct-content sequence*,
which now matches (every fade value rendered, no drops). The pace pump `0x5b1030`
and the pre/post side-effect hooks stay stubbed **on purpose** — they are NOT the
pacing key (that was the driving cadence, fixed in `main_loop_body`); they matter
only for the BGM cue / per-entry updates, port them when those subsystems land.

## Next move (pick one — recommendation first)

1. **★ (recommended — the user opted in @ ckpt 48) PORT THE IN-GAME ENGINE
   `0x59f2c0` to match the golden.**  The trace is extended in-game, the RETAIL
   golden is captured (`runs/tas-ingame-1`, opening town from ~flip 1150), and
   (ckpt 50) the **game-entry anchor + port seam are DONE + verified both sides**
   (port game_enter@1116 / retail @1092, rng 0x40d00581 matches).  The engine is
   **surveyed/decomposed** (see `docs/findings/in-game-intro.md` "Entry-function
   map").  Remaining = **plan 3** in that doc, smallest visible win first:
   - ~~(a) game-entry anchor~~ **DONE (ckpt 50)** — retail `0x59f2c0` + port
     `enter_game` emit `game_enter`.
   - ~~(b) port seam~~ **DONE (ckpt 50)** — `PROLOGUE_DONE → enter_game`.
   - ~~(3a) Find map-0x3f2's resource banks + load path~~ **DONE (ckpt 51).**
     No per-map file: the town lazily decodes pre-registered sprite banks via
     `ar_sprite_decode`; map layout is compiled-in static data.  Wired the
     deferred boot batches g2/g3/g5 (title still `differ_px=0`).  Residual: the
     EXE-NULL banks `0x570-0x572` (register with `settings=NULL` in 3b).  Probe:
     `frida_capture.py --res-probe`.  Full map: in-game-intro.md "Resource banks".
   - ~~(3b-i) **Stand up a `game_drive`**~~ **DONE (ckpt 52)** —
     `src/game_drive.{c,h}` mirrors `prologue_drive`; `enter_game` stands it up,
     `main_loop_body` steps it once/frame; `game_render`=`zdd_object_clear`
     (black map-load frame).  Verified live (game_enter@1116, in-game frames black,
     title unaffected).
   - (3b-ii) **Port the world construction + a render slice.**  `game_render`
     today clears black; to draw the town it needs the world the engine builds:
     port the **0x59f2c0 fresh-entry arm** (the 0x4120 map object alloc + field
     init + the `&DAT_006940c8` registry copy via 0x585000; host-test the field
     writes against the decomp), then the **0x586010 sim step** (enough to
     populate what the backdrop reads), then a slice of **`0x5a00c0`** (13.7 KB;
     reuses ported `ar_sprite_decode`/zdd/ramps).  Target the **static town
     backdrop/tilemap FIRST** (golden flip ~1150), diff vs `runs/tas-ingame-1`
     anchored on `game_enter`.  Register the EXE-NULL banks 0x570-0x572 at the
     engine-time site once the slot indices surface (settings=a `sotes.exe`
     datafile handle).  Then entities, then the dialogue box (~flip 2200, likely
     the glyph pipeline again).  Use `--res-probe` on the PORT too to confirm it
     decodes the same bank set as retail.
   The two giant children — **`0x586010` (6 KB, sim/draw step)** + **`0x5a00c0`
   (13.7 KB, render dispatch)** — are the real body; `0x59ec30`/`0x59f2c0` are
   the wrapper + world-setup/loop around them.

2. **(deferred polish) The fade-out frames' RENDER — the box-alpha arm.**  The
   transition TIMING is aligned (ckpt 48) but the port re-renders the new-game
   menu **opaque** during the 20 fade frames, while retail fades the box-panel
   alpha (`0x48cf80`'s alpha arm via `0x5bd550`) + the GDI menu text.  So those
   ~20 transition frames (port ~801-820 vs retail ~795-814) are NOT yet bit-
   exact.  To close: port `0x48cf80`'s alpha arm (the 9-slice box blit blended by
   `node.field_54`) and capture **retail's fade-out frames** (~795-814 — drive
   retail to the commit, capture that window) to model how the GDI menu text
   fades during the transition (likely the scene is composited to an offscreen
   then alpha-blitted — needs the capture to confirm).  Self-contained; doesn't
   need new scope.  The fade STATE (`field_54` ramp) is already tracked, so this
   is purely the render half.

3. **(verification, cheap) Re-capture retail's cutscene under lockstep + re-run
   `tas_diff` to re-confirm 63/64 after any prologue change.**  The recipe is in
   `docs/findings/tas-harness.md` (port@821 vs retail@815, runs/tas-retail-gem,
   window 2).  The pre-existing **tick-0 entry-frame** residual (84684 px — the
   port renders the first gem tick while retail's first present at prologue_enter
   is still black) is a small prologue_drive first-present item worth closing too
   (defer the first prologue render by one tick so tick 0 is black like retail).

3. **(deferred polish, optional) Finish the new-game scene's remaining CHROME.**
   The box panel + menu text + selection cursor render bit-exact; port the rest in
   roughly this order (cheapest visual win first):
   ~~(a) the box widget panel~~ **DONE (ckpt 40, quirk #67, `src/newgame_box.c`).**
   ~~(a') the selection cursor~~ **DONE + BIT-EXACT (ckpt 43, quirk #69).**
   Geometry ported ckpt 41 (`src/newgame_cursor.{c,h}`, `0x48d940` type-1, base 16
   + frames{0,1,2,3}→16-19, row-0 base (40,26)); bank ID'd ckpt 42 (0x455 slot 43,
   bottom-up, quirk #68); the render bug fixed ckpt 43 (a transposed trim scan, NOT
   the mis-diagnosed videomem path — `bs_trim_opaque_rect` arg order, quirk #69).
   `g_newgame_cursor_enable=1`.  Verified: port Flip 761 vs golden → menu-box
   `differ_px=0`.  Proof tool for the trim: `tools/extract/cursor_trim_probe.c`.
   ~~(b) the tooltip TEXT node~~ **DONE + BIT-EXACT (ckpt 44, quirk #70,
   `src/glyph_wrap.{c,h}`).**  The help line is a standalone WORD-WRAPPING text
   node (`this+0x170`), not the menu grid; the break is greedy word-wrap at
   width 68 (NOT a `%n` — the difficulty source string has none).  Ported the
   justify `FUN_0040e5e0` (ASCII path) + the `%n`/`%m`/`%w` parse `FUN_0040f040`;
   `newgame_render` picks `newgame_scene_tooltip`, wraps at 68, draws each row at
   (72,416+r·28) with the menu's shadow+colours.  Verified: difficulty tooltip
   wraps 65/52 across y=416/444 → **0 text-colored pixels differ**.  (The build
   chain `FUN_0040e360`→parse/justify/commit + the substitution table —
   `this+0x164`, empty for English — is documented in quirk #70; the port fuses
   parse+justify and renders directly, as main.c already does for the menu grid.)
   **REMAINING tooltip residual = 9px box-panel RGB565 1-LSB rounding (pre-existing,
   NOT text)** — see ckpt-44 OPEN above; a separate sprite-decode item.
   ~~(c) the option picker submenu~~ **DONE + USER-CONFIRMED (ckpt 45, quirk #71,
   `src/newgame_picker.{c,h}`).**  `FUN_00567ba0` ported pure (value list
   `FUN_00568320` + build + seek `FUN_00419900` + nav/commit/cancel), wired into
   `newgame_drive` as a modal submode, rendered at (288,128) over the menu; commit
   calls `newgame_scene_set_option`.  Bit-exact retail diff is an OPEN gate (the
   flip counter freezes in `0x565d10`'s modal pump — capture/inject are flip-keyed;
   needs a non-flip-keyed harness).  **NEXT — the transition (recommended below):**
   (d) the **Start→game path**: the Elemental-Stone intro (`0x564160` →
   `0x5642e0`/`0x56cd20` timed cutscene → `0x59ec30` game proper).  START is a
   stub today (re-displays title).  **This is the prologue critical path** — the
   committed trace navigates to "Start Game" + confirms (never opens the picker),
   so this is the item actually on the path to "first frame in-game".
   Deferrable polish: the box **fade-in** (`0x48cf80`'s alpha arm via `0x5bd550`);
   the picker bit-exact gate (a harness that drives/captures inside the modal pump).
   How to drive there (PORT side, self-serviceable): trace `{"frame":620,"ids":[36]}`
   into the **game dir**, then `./build/opensummoners-launcher.exe --timeout-ms 45000
   -- /tmp/oss.exe --hide-window --frames 1100 --input-trace ng_trace.jsonl
   --capture-frames "700,760,840" --capture-dir=C:\osscap` (use a **no-space**
   capture dir — the launcher splits the game-dir path on its space).  Frames
   after ~660 are the newgame scene (`phase=-1`).  RETAIL side: `--box-probe`
   (Flip freezes at 422 in the modal pump — flip-gated probes see only the
   title→menu transition, which is when the box first renders).
2. ~~The new-game config menu BUILDER.~~ **DONE (ckpt 37, quirk #64).**
   `src/newgame_menu.{c,h}` builds the case-0x24 grid (`FUN_00564780` case 0x24 +
   `FUN_00411940` setup); host-tested to emit retail's `TextOutA` stream
   draw-for-draw (`tests/test_newgame_menu.c`).  Geometry: col0 x=72, col1 x=232,
   pitch 28.  Remaining chips for the broader text system: the escape expander
   (`0x4034f0`/`0x4051d0`, hooked NULL — English labels don't need it), the
   sprite-cell render mode (`0x48e200` `param_1==0`), and the screen-settings
   row-append twin `0x40f800` (used by case 0x20, not case 0x24).
3. ~~Dispatch the title return code instead of exiting~~ **DONE (ckpt 33,
   `app_flow_dispatch` + `reenter_title`, quirk #60).** Exit exits; commits
   dispatch; unported arms re-display the title.

## Tooling added ckpt 36

- **`frida_capture.py --textout-probe [--textout-frames LO,HI]`** — hooks
  `gdi32!TextOutA`/`ExtTextOutA` in retail and logs each glyph draw
  (x/y/glyph-bytes/text-colour/bk-mode + the **selected `LOGFONTA`** via
  `GetCurrentObject(OBJ_FONT)`+`GetObjectA`) to `<run>/textout.jsonl`, deduped
  to the distinct draw set. The flip window skips the intro/demo debug-text
  flood (the probe returns before any GDI query outside `[LO,HI]`). This is the
  **GDI-text ground-truth** capture: which `ar_register_fonts` HFONT a scene
  picks, the colours, and the per-glyph advance. The `installTextOutProbe` /
  `ensureTextOutQueryFns` / `readSelectedFont` pattern in the agent generalises
  to any GDI primitive.
- **`tests/scenarios/new-game-through/trace-retimed.jsonl`** — presses Start at
  flip ~400 (the live title menu under the harness), vs the old `trace.jsonl`'s
  flip-2050 which lands in the auto-demo. Use this to drive retail to the
  new-game config menu.
- **`tests/scenarios/new-game-through/goldens/`** — `retail-newgame-config-menu.png`
  (the captured menu) + `retail-newgame-config-textout.jsonl` (the full
  per-glyph stream) — the parity ground truth for the menu builder port.

## Tooling added ckpt 32

- **`--menu-trace`** (`src/title_sink.c`, `title_sink_menu_trace`) — logs a
  stderr line whenever the highlighted menu row changes
  (`[sink] menu cursor row 1 -> 2 (y=80)`), so injected nav is verified at the
  cursor-state level, not by eyeballing pixels. A CLI flag, **not** an env var:
  WSLInterop does not forward arbitrary Linux env vars to the Windows child
  (only nix-shell-exported ones like `OPENSUMMONERS_GAME_DIR` reach `getenv`).
- **Menu-nav trace recipe** (self-serviceable, no Frida): write a
  `{"frame":N,"ids":[..]}` JSONL into the **game dir** (the child's CWD; a
  Windows exe can't read `/tmp`), then
  `OSS=/tmp/oss.exe; $OSS --hide-window --menu-trace --frames 720 --input-trace trace.jsonl`.
  Button ids: **1=up, 3=down**, 2/4=page, **0x24(=36)=confirm**, 0x22=abort.
  Time presses **after ~flip 577** (cursor visible); the input gate opens
  earlier (~flip 547). Confirm on row N → scene returns that row's action id
  (Start `0x1a`=26, Continue `0x1c`, Bonus `0x1e`, Options `0x1d`, Exit `8`).

## Tooling added this ckpt (31)

- **`frida_capture.py --seed-pin` / `--seed-value`** (default ON, `0x4f5347`) —
  the agent hooks `FUN_0056c070` and writes `DAT_008a4f94` to the fixed seed at
  the first spawn, so retail's phase-7 twinkles match the port's pinned-seed
  build. One-shot.
- **`subtitle_anim_start` TAS anchor** — the same first-spawn hook always emits
  `{kind:'anchor', name:'subtitle_anim_start', frame}` (recorded in the run
  summary's `anchors`), independent of seed-pin. Use it as tick 0 to align
  captures, since retail's intro pacing jitters the flip index run-to-run.
- **`/tmp` diff scripts** (not committed): per-tick `differ_px` sweep of port
  frames vs a dense retail flip window — how `differ_px=0` was found at
  port-465/retail-939. Re-derive with PIL `ImageChops`/numpy if needed.

## Tooling added ckpt 30

- **`frida_capture.py --fade-probe`** — hooks `FUN_00448c80` (the fade→alpha
  ramp), logs the first `(value,div)` per Flip → `<run>/fade_level.jsonl`. In
  phases 0–4 the first call's value IS the studio/title logo fade, so this gives
  retail's logo fade per flip → match a port frame at the same fade and diff (how
  logos #2/#3 were verified `differ_px=0`). **Caveat:** in phase 7 the first call
  is the first *sparkle* (`min(7·fade,1000)`), not the raw fade; phases 5–6 don't
  call `0x448c80` at all (the gap in the jsonl pinpoints them). Generalises the
  `--cursor-probe` pattern (`installFadeProbe` in the agent).

## Tooling added ckpt 29

- **`frida_capture.py --pace-probe`** (+ `--pace-every N`) — timestamps Flips →
  `<run>/pace.jsonl` + a live `flips/s` print, and stamps the cursor-onset
  event with wall-clock ms. This is how R3 was measured (retail: ~127 flips/s,
  menu onset Flip 1172 @ 9.23 s). Use `--no-turbo`.
- **Port `pace:` phase log** (`src/main.c`) — logs each phase transition with
  Flip count + wall-clock (`pace: phase A -> B @ flip=N t=Mms`). The port-side
  counterpart of `--pace-probe`; how the port's wall-clock-to-menu was checked.
- **`/tmp/pace_sim.py`** (not committed) — a Python replica of `title_pace_step`
  + `title_fade_step` used to validate the driving fix offline (ratio 1.00, 0
  missed fade values) before touching C. Re-create from quirk #54 if needed.
- **`--hide-window` now skips the desktop present** (`drive_present`) — kills
  the screen flicker (quirk #55); captures unaffected (read `primary_obj` first).

## Tooling from ckpt 28

- **`frida_capture.py --cursor-probe`** — hooks retail `FUN_0056c470` (menu
  cursor draw), logs per-Flip `level_num`/`level_div` → `<run>/cursor_level.jsonl`
  + a distinct-value summary. The pattern (read 8 stack slots, find the known
  `0x4b0` div to anchor the arg layout, tag by `g_flip_frame`) **generalises to
  any FUN_ whose args you want to measure live** — copy `installCursorProbe` in
  the agent + the message handler in `frida_capture.py`. Use `--no-turbo`.
- **Port capture now logs pulse state** (`src/main.c`): each `--capture-frames`
  line prints `phase=… fade=… menu_fade=…` so a port frame can be matched to a
  retail golden at the same cursor-pulse phase (capture goldens WITH
  `--cursor-probe` to know their `local_58`, then diff at equal value → 0 px).
- **Harness default exe fixed** — `frida_capture.py` now spawns
  `vendor/original/sotes.unpacked.exe` (the unpacked PE co-located in the game
  dir), NOT the packed `sotes.exe` (which stalls at 0 frames). engine-quirks #53.
- (still here) `--capture-frames`, `SINK_RESOLVE_DEBUG`, `push_comparison.py`.
- **`docs/parity-ledger.md`** — entry **#1 is now CONFIRMED bit-exact** (title
  menu, phase-matched, `differ_px==0`). Re-diff + update after render changes.

## Module inventory (22 modules) — render pipeline COMPLETE; text pipeline CLOSED end-to-end; new-game config scene = box + menu text + cursor + tooltip text all bit-exact + the option picker submenu ported/user-confirmed (Start→game pending)

Pixel-Drawer, Asset-Register, Bitmap-Session, WndProc, ZDD wrapper, cs_dispatch,
app_pump, title_scene (`FUN_0056aea0`, fully ported+wired+driven), input
(`FUN_0043c110`), obj_container, menu_list, **title_render** (compositor +
wrappers), **title_sink** (cmd→ZDD bridge, banks 19/20), **title_drive** (caller
side of the runner), **rng** (the MSVC LCG `FUN_005bf505`/`_5bf4fb`, ckpt 31),
**title_particles** (phase-7 sparkle pool: spawn `0x56c070` + update `0x56ba69` +
cull `0x56c030`, ckpt 31), **app_flow** (post-title dispatch = `FUN_00562ea0`
tail switch, ckpt 33), **glyph_text** (the cell-grid text/glyph layout builder:
`glyph_cell_layout`/`glyph_token_search` = `0x40fa00`/`0x40fd20`, ckpt 34 —
build half; escape expander still hooked-NULL), **glyph_render** (the GDI text
renderer: `glyph_grid_render`/`glyph_row_draw`/`glyph_ruby_draw` =
`0x48e200`/`0x48e860`/`0x48e6d0`, ckpt 35 — pure walk over a `glyph_gdi_ops`
vtable + real GDI in `glyph_render_win32.c`; sprite-cell mode deferred),
**newgame_menu** (the new-game config menu builder: `menu_grid_append` =
`0x412160`, `newgame_option_label`/`_value`/`_tooltip` =
`0x566570`/`0x566a80`/`0x566850` arms, `newgame_config_build` = `0x564780`
case 0x24, ckpt 37/38 — emits retail's `TextOutA` stream draw-for-draw),
**newgame_scene** (the run-loop model = `0x564780` case-0x24 loop body, ckpt 38:
`newgame_scene_tooltip`/`_dispatch`/`_set_option` — pure state machine; the
Win32 pump `0x565d10`/`0x43bca0`, picker `0x567ba0`, box widgets `0x411940` NOT
ported, the drive's job),
**newgame_box** (the 9-slice box panel = `0x48cf80` opaque arm, ckpt 40),
**newgame_cursor** (the selection-cursor geometry = `0x48d940` type-1, ckpt 41 —
bank 0x455 frames 16-19 bottom-up, render bit-exact ckpt 43, quirk #68/#69),
**glyph_wrap** (the tooltip text-node word-wrap = `0x40e5e0` justify + `0x40f040`
`%n`/`%m`/`%w` parse, ckpt 44, quirk #70 — pure + host-tested; SJIS kinsoku
deferred; rendered directly in `newgame_render`),
**newgame_picker** (the option picker submenu = `0x567ba0` default arm, ckpt 45,
quirk #71 — value list `0x568320` + build + cursor-seek `0x419900` + nav/commit;
wired into `newgame_drive` as a modal submode, rendered at (288,128); bit-exact
retail diff an OPEN gate — flip-frozen modal pump).
**8d** (`zdd_object_new_cell/_build_cell/_copy_cell_pixels`
+ `bs_convert_*` + slicer) ported ckpt 25, **now firing live** (banks registered
ckpt 26). `main.c` drives the scene against the live ZDD with the 8d hooks +
`init_sprite_banks` wired; on a menu commit it `app_flow_dispatch`es the result
(Exit→shutdown, else→`reenter_title`). `--no-title-scene` restores the legacy
present loop.

## How to run / verify live (self-serviceable — [[reference_frida]])

```
# build (single-TU, full rebuild) inside nix develop:
make -C src all && make -C tests run        # 647 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip

# capture title frames (writes BMPs into the game dir = Windows C: drive):
cp build/opensummoners-debug.exe /tmp/oss.exe
./build/opensummoners-launcher.exe --timeout-ms 35000 -- /tmp/oss.exe \
    --hide-window --frames 2200 --capture-frames "60,200,400,700"
# then BMP->PNG (PIL) from /mnt/c/.../Fortune Summoners/port_frame_*.bmp and read it
```

NB Flip frames advance ~1 per 2 main-loop iterations (pace split), so reaching
Flip 700 needs a generous `--frames`/timeout. `run-opensummoners.sh` rebuilds
the debug exe with default flags — use the launcher directly if you need a
`-DSINK_RESOLVE_DEBUG` build to survive.

## Active goal (UPDATED, user @ ckpt 48/49 — the trace is now extended in-game)

**The title + new-game + prologue scenes are 1:1 (title bit-exact; new-game box/
text/cursor/tooltip/picker bit-exact + user-confirmed; prologue content
bit-exact 63/64 + the new-game→prologue transition timing aligned, ckpt 48).
The ckpt-13 milestone is MET.**

**NEW directive (user @ ckpt 48): EXTEND THE TRACE IN-GAME.**  *"yes extend the
trace.  start by just spamming Z after the prologue begins, give the trace ~1
min of frames, then continue matching retail."*  Done the first half (ckpt 49):
the trace spams Z (id 0x24, a prologue beat) → `0x59ec30(0,0,0x3f2)` → the
opening town of Tilelia + story dialogue; RETAIL golden captured
(`runs/tas-ingame-1`, game from ~flip 1150).  **Now: port the in-game engine
`0x59f2c0` to 1:1-match that golden** — same port-and-diff loop, scene by scene.
See `docs/findings/in-game-intro.md` + Next move #1.

## Open RE threads (see ROADMAP subsystem map for the rest)

- **Title render-half arms — ALL WIRED + bit-exact** (`title_sink.c`):
  `MENU_CURSOR` (ckpt 28), `LOGO` (folded into `SPRITE_LEVEL`, ckpt 30),
  `SPARKLE` subtitle-reveal sweep (ckpt 30), and the **`FUN_0056c070` particle
  twinkles** (spawn/update/cull/draw, ckpt 31, quirks #57/#58 — DONE, bit-exact).
  (`TITLE_DRAW_LOGO` sink case + the `draw_logo`/`draw_sparkle`/`draw_cursor` ctx
  callbacks are now vestigial fallbacks; nothing emits LOGO.)
- **Outer-loop side-effect hooks** (stubbed in `title_scene_hooks`): `0x5b1030`
  (message pump), `0x43e140`/`0x40fe00`/`0x566250` (pre), `0x43c2e0` (per-entry).
  **`0x56c930` (post) is now WIRED** (ckpt 32) — its mode-1 `+0x54` ramp opens
  the menu-input gate (`drive_post_update` → `menu_owner_transition_step`); modes
  0/2 (submenu slide) are still deferred inside that port. **NB the rest are NOT
  the intro-pacing key** (that was the driving cadence, fixed in `main_loop_body`
  ckpt 29 — see quirk #54); `0x43e140`/`0x40fe00` are audio/joystick updates,
  port when those land. `0x43c2e0` animates a node's *child* widgets (gated on
  `+0x54>=1000`) — needed for in-row sub-widget animation, not basic nav.
- **Other register batches** not yet called at boot: `ar_register_fonts`,
  `ar_register_palette_ramps` (FUN_0057a330), the big `FUN_0056e190` (442
  sprites), sounds. The title path doesn't need them, but the new-game/prologue
  scenes will — register them the same way (all take the sotesd HMODULE).
- **Dynamic text pipeline — build + GDI render PORTED** (ckpt 34/35,
  `glyph_text.c` + `glyph_render.c`). Remaining chips: the **escape expander**
  (`0x4034f0`/`0x4051d0`, hooked NULL — port when an escape-bearing string needs
  it), the **row-append `0x40f800`**, and the **sprite-cell render mode**
  (`0x48e200` `param_1==0`, ZDD blits). **Pixel-diff vs retail still pending**
  (Next move #1).
- **SFX `0x411390`** / joystick `0x5ba120/_290` / save-notify `0x41bb80` /
  watchdog `0x40a5d0` — the four `title_menu_input_step` side effects.
- **Audio ZDM** `FUN_005bab10`/`_5bc150` + SFX `FUN_00411390` — milestone 3.
- **Launcher `config.dat`** `FUN_005a4770` (46 KB) — milestone 4. We now know it
  loads sotesd/w/p.dll and stores their handles at DAT_008a6e74/78/7c.
- **Input producer** (DInput `GetDeviceState`, vtable `[0x24]`) + axis-held
  flags (quirk #41) — black box; `mem_watch.py` is the tool.
- God-object `DAT_008a9b50`/`DAT_008a6e80` layout (quirk #15) — model as we go.

## How to apply

When the user says "continue RE work" (or similar):
1. Read this file first, then `STATUS.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Pick the recommended next move (or whichever the user redirects to).
3. Port-and-test style: small unit → host test → commit. Each ported function
   gets a `FUN_XXXXXX` provenance comment; pin retail offsets via
   `_Static_assert` under `#if UINTPTR_MAX == 0xFFFFFFFFu`. Reference UNPORTED
   callees by bare VA, never `FUN_` (it inflates the ledger).
4. **Append any engine quirk** to `findings/engine-quirks.md` (now at #51).
5. **Regen** `gen_port_ledger.py` + `gen_frontier.py` after a port; check the
   headline didn't move unexpectedly.
6. **Verify rendering with `--capture-frames`** vs the goldens — self-serviceable.
7. Update THIS file each meaningful checkpoint; append to PROGRESS.md.
8. Suggest a `/clear` at the natural stop point.
