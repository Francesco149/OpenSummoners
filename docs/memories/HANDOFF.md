# Session handoff — last updated 2026-06-02 (title renders + cursor wired, ckpt 27)

> **ckpt 27 — menu cursor wired (commit `40741a4`).** Built the alpha-ramp blend
> descriptors (`init_alpha_ramps` → `pd_boot_init_slots(NULL)` = RGB565, exposed
> as the `ramp_a/ramp_b` pointer tables into the sink) and wired the
> `TITLE_DRAW_MENU_CURSOR` sink arm (resolve CURSOR bank pool 20 + draw via
> `title_draw_menu_cursor`). The "▶ Start" selection cursor now renders. Menu
> diff vs retail golden dropped **2964 px → 955 px (1.0% → 0.31%)** — **NOT yet
> 1:1**: a 955px edge residual on the cursor remains OPEN (parity-ledger R1).
> Two hypotheses to investigate (bit-exact is the bar — no hand-waving): (1) the
> cursor highlight **pulses** (animated `level_num` = retail's path-dependent
> `[esp+0x20]`), so port Flip 200 vs retail Flip 1900 are at different pulse
> phases — really an intro-pacing/phase-alignment problem; (2) our idx-19
> full-add over-brightens the cursor. 648 host tests pass (+1). **The alpha ramps

**This is the first thing to read at the start of every session.**

Rolling state — REWRITE on each meaningful checkpoint. `docs/PROGRESS.md` is the
append-only changelog; this file is "where to pick up *right now*".

## ⭐ Current state (ckpt 27): title renders; one open residual + gaps remain (NOT yet bit-exact)

The whole chain runs live, every frame, producing correct pixels:

```
title_scene_step → title_sink → resolve_frame(bank 19/20)
   → ar_sprite_slot_frame(slot, id)
        → ar_sprite_decode (0x4184a0)  [NOW FIRES — banks registered]
             → bs_decode_resource(sotesd.dll, 0x91b, "DATA", compressed)
             → ar_sprite_slice (0x4188b0): trim + format switch + build
                  → ar_sheet_format_hook → bs_convert_to_16bpp (RGB565)
                  → ar_frame_build_hook → zdd_object_new_cell (8d) → real surface
        → title_draw_sprite → keyed blit onto primary → present → VISIBLE
```

**Verified pixel-perfect** against retail goldens for the title art + menu
layout. The three remaining divergences are the **next layer** (NOT rendering
bugs — the pipeline is correct):

1. **Intro pacing** — the port reaches the menu by Flip frame ~200; retail is
   still on the Lizsoft studio splash there (retail ~1900 to menu). The port
   **rushes/skips the intro fade**: the pace pump `0x5b1030` (and the pre/post
   side-effect hooks) are still stubbed in `title_scene_hooks`, so phases tick
   per-frame instead of being time-gated. To 1:1-match retail's timeline these
   must apply the real per-phase delays/frame-counters.
2. **Menu cursor highlight absent** — retail highlights the selected row
   ("Start"); the port doesn't. That's the **CURSOR bank (pool 20) / the
   `MENU_CURSOR` sink arm**, still a deferred no-op. (The bank IS registered and
   resolvable now — just not drawn.) Wire the `MENU_CURSOR` arm in `title_sink`.
3. **Lizsoft studio splash not drawn** — the `LOGO` sink arm (alpha-ramp draw)
   is a deferred no-op, so the studio fade renders nothing. Wire `LOGO` (+
   `SPARKLE`) — needs the runtime alpha ramps `0x8a92b8`/`0x8a9308` populated.

## Next move (pick one — recommendation first)

> Context: rendering is DONE and pixel-verified. The active goal (user, ckpt 13)
> is **1:1 parity with retail** for title + new-game + prologue. So the work is
> now closing the three fidelity gaps above, in fidelity-impact order.

1. **(recommended) Wire the deferred sink arms — `MENU_CURSOR` then `LOGO`/
   `SPARKLE`.** `MENU_CURSOR` is the cheapest visible win and the bank is
   already live: in `title_sink.c` the `MENU_CURSOR` arm should resolve
   `AR_SPR_TITLE_CURSOR` (pool 20) at the selected row index and blit the
   highlight. Then `LOGO`/`SPARKLE` (alpha-ramp draws) — these need the runtime
   ramps `0x8a92b8`/`0x8a9308` (pixel_drawer `g_pd_boot_group_a/_b`) populated;
   check whether `ar_register_*` or a boot step fills them, else model them.
   See `title_sink.h` for the arm contracts. **Verify each with
   `--capture-frames` against the goldens** (self-serviceable, BMP→PNG→read).
2. **Intro pacing fidelity** — make the port's phase timeline match retail so a
   given Flip frame shows the same content as the golden at that frame. Port the
   pace pump `0x5b1030` + the pre/post side-effect hooks (`0x43e140`/`0x40fe00`/
   `0x566250` pre, `0x56c930` post) currently stubbed in `title_scene_hooks`,
   OR find the frame-counter/timer that gates each fade phase. This is what
   makes frame-for-frame golden diffing meaningful (right now port Flip N ≠
   retail Flip N until both settle on the menu).
3. **Live-validate `--input-trace`** (ckpt 24, still unverified) + drive the
   menu nav so the CURSOR highlight moves — pairs naturally with #1. Does an
   injected DOWN actually move the selection on the port? Frida self-serviceable,
   no-turbo. Then extend toward the new-game menus (the user gates trace
   extension on "once we have prologue and main menu rendering").

## Tooling added this ckpt

- **Port frame capture** (`src/main.c`): `--capture-frames "60,200,…"
  [--capture-dir <path>]` → `<dir>/port_frame_NNNNN.bmp` of the composed primary
  (default dir "." = the game dir after `init_game_dir`, i.e. a Windows path
  readable from WSL at `/mnt/c/.../Fortune Summoners/`). Convert + inspect:
  `PIL.Image.open(bmp).save(png)` in `nix develop`, then read the PNG.
- **`SINK_RESOLVE_DEBUG`** compile flag (`title_sink.c`): logs the first
  resolve per (bank, hit/miss) — proves the decode chain ran. Build the debug
  exe with `CFLAGS="… -DSINK_RESOLVE_DEBUG"`.
- Goldens to diff against: `runs/title-idle/frames/frame_*.png` (retail,
  Flip-indexed). Port menu == retail `frame_01900.png`.
- **`tools/push_comparison.py --port P.png --retail R.png`** — pushes a
  port|retail amplified-diff `comparison` to the llm-feed (use this, not a
  montage, when comparing vs retail so the visual diff is inspectable).
- **`docs/parity-ledger.md`** — the list of frames CONFIRMED pixel-1:1 vs
  retail (regression guard). Title menu (idle) is entry #1: identical except
  the selection cursor/sparkle. Re-diff + update it after render-path changes.

## Module inventory (13 modules) — render pipeline COMPLETE

Pixel-Drawer, Asset-Register, Bitmap-Session, WndProc, ZDD wrapper, cs_dispatch,
app_pump, title_scene (`FUN_0056aea0`, fully ported+wired+driven), input
(`FUN_0043c110`), obj_container, menu_list, **title_render** (compositor +
wrappers), **title_sink** (cmd→ZDD bridge, banks 19/20), **title_drive** (caller
side of the runner). **8d** (`zdd_object_new_cell/_build_cell/_copy_cell_pixels`
+ `bs_convert_*` + slicer) ported ckpt 25, **now firing live** (banks registered
ckpt 26). `main.c` drives the scene against the live ZDD with the 8d hooks +
`init_sprite_banks` wired. `--no-title-scene` restores the legacy present loop.

## How to run / verify live (self-serviceable — [[reference_frida]])

```
# build (single-TU, full rebuild) inside nix develop:
make -C src all && make -C tests run        # 647 pass / 0 fail / 6 skip

# capture title frames (writes BMPs into the game dir = Windows C: drive):
cp build/opensummoners-debug.exe /tmp/oss.exe
./build/opensummoners-launcher.exe --timeout-ms 35000 -- /tmp/oss.exe \
    --hide-window --frames 2200 --capture-frames "60,200,400,700"
# then BMP->PNG (PIL) from /mnt/c/.../Fortune Summoners/port_frame_*.bmp and read it
```

NB Flip frames advance ~1 per 2 main-loop iterations (pace split), so reaching
Flip 700 needs a generous `--frames`/timeout. `run-opensummoners.sh` rebuilds
the debug exe with default flags — use the launcher directly if you need a
`-DSINK_RESOLVE_DEBUG` build to survive.

## Active goal (unchanged, user @ ckpt 13)

**Make the PORT render the scenes the new-game trace covers — title menu +
new-game menus + prologue (stone/narration) — to 1:1-match retail, using the
harness goldens as the pixel target. Do NOT extend the trace toward in-game yet;
"once we have prologue and main menu rendering we extend the trace."**

Title menu renders with a 955px OPEN residual on the cursor (parity-ledger R1 —
NOT yet bit-exact; bit-exact is the bar). After closing it (phase-alignment /
exact cursor blend): drive the new-game menus (the `--input-trace` path) and
confirm they render, then the prologue.

## Open RE threads (see ROADMAP subsystem map for the rest)

- **Deferred sink arms** `LOGO`/`SPARKLE`/`MENU_CURSOR` (`title_sink.c`) — the
  remaining title-screen fidelity. CURSOR bank (pool 20) is registered + live;
  LOGO/SPARKLE need the runtime alpha ramps `0x8a92b8`/`0x8a9308` populated.
- **Outer-loop side-effect hooks** (stubbed in `title_scene_hooks`): `0x5b1030`
  (pace pump — the intro-pacing key), `0x43e140`/`0x40fe00`/`0x566250` (pre),
  `0x56c930` (post), `0x43c2e0` (per-entry). Porting the pump is what fixes
  intro-pacing fidelity (Next move #2).
- **Other register batches** not yet called at boot: `ar_register_fonts`,
  `ar_register_palette_ramps` (FUN_0057a330), the big `FUN_0056e190` (442
  sprites), sounds. The title path doesn't need them, but the new-game/prologue
  scenes will — register them the same way (all take the sotesd HMODULE).
- **`0x40fa00`** cell text-layout / glyph builder (SJIS, `#`-colour escapes) —
  the menu text currently renders (pre-baked into the menu-bg sprite?), but
  dynamic text will need this.
- **SFX `0x411390`** / joystick `0x5ba120/_290` / save-notify `0x41bb80` /
  watchdog `0x40a5d0` — the four `title_menu_input_step` side effects.
- **Audio ZDM** `FUN_005bab10`/`_5bc150` + SFX `FUN_00411390` — milestone 3.
- **Launcher `config.dat`** `FUN_005a4770` (46 KB) — milestone 4. We now know it
  loads sotesd/w/p.dll and stores their handles at DAT_008a6e74/78/7c.
- **Input producer** (DInput `GetDeviceState`, vtable `[0x24]`) + axis-held
  flags (quirk #41) — black box; `mem_watch.py` is the tool.
- God-object `DAT_008a9b50`/`DAT_008a6e80` layout (quirk #15) — model as we go.

## How to apply

When the user says "continue RE work" (or similar):
1. Read this file first, then `STATUS.md` + `ROADMAP.md`.
2. Pick the recommended next move (or whichever the user redirects to).
3. Port-and-test style: small unit → host test → commit. Each ported function
   gets a `FUN_XXXXXX` provenance comment; pin retail offsets via
   `_Static_assert` under `#if UINTPTR_MAX == 0xFFFFFFFFu`. Reference UNPORTED
   callees by bare VA, never `FUN_` (it inflates the ledger).
4. **Append any engine quirk** to `findings/engine-quirks.md` (now at #51).
5. **Regen** `gen_port_ledger.py` + `gen_frontier.py` after a port; check the
   headline didn't move unexpectedly.
6. **Verify rendering with `--capture-frames`** vs the goldens — self-serviceable.
7. Update THIS file each meaningful checkpoint; append to PROGRESS.md.
8. Suggest a `/clear` at the natural stop point.
