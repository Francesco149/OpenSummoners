# Engine quirks

A running collection of small things the original Fortune Summoners
engine does that are weird, charming, or inexplicable.  Each entry is
short — one paragraph or two, optional code snippet, source pointer.

> See `docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` for the convention.  Add an entry whenever
> something makes you blink at the decompiler output.  Bias toward
> recording it before you forget *why* it surprised you.

## 1. The bulk of the .exe lives in `.rsrc`, not `.text`

`sotes.exe` is 64 MB on disk, but `.text` is only 1.85 MB.  56 MB is in
`.rsrc` — the PE resource directory.  This is an unusual choice for a
2012-era Windows game; most contemporaries shipped assets in separate
archive files (`.pak`, `.dat`, `.cpr`) and kept the .exe lean.

Lizsoft may have done this to keep all assets in a single tamper-proof
file (the Steam DRM wrap *only* covers the `.text` section; the
resource directory's bytes survive Steamless unmodified, so a comparison
of pre- and post-Steamless sotes.exe is a fast way to confirm where the
asset payload lives).

Possibly relevant: `sotesd.dll` (168 MB) and `sotesw.dll` (82 MB) are
also disproportionately large for code; they may be additional
resource-style asset bundles.  TBD which is which until we look at the
imports of both DLLs and the `LoadLibrary` calls in `sotes.exe`.

> 📍 See `docs/PLAN.md` §4 for the section table.  Confirm by extracting
> .rsrc with `wrestool -x vendor/original/sotes.exe` once we set up an
> extractor.

## 2. Steam DRM is SteamStub Variant 2.1 — Steamless unpacks cleanly

The on-disk `sotes.exe` is wrapped with SteamStub Variant 2.1 (the
classic 2011-2013 era variant Lizsoft would have had access to when they
went up on Steam in Jan 2012).  `Steamless.CLI.exe` identifies the
variant on first sight and reconstructs the original entry point and
code section without any manual help: original entry RVA `0x03d0f2ee`
inside the appended `.bind` section becomes `0x004c0a8f` inside `.text`
after unpacking.

The Steam DRM only covers the `.text` section.  Post-Steamless, all
non-code sections (`.rdata`, `.data`, `.rsrc`) byte-match the pre-Steamless
file.

> 📍 `tools/setup.sh` does the detection (objdump section list) +
> unpacking.  See `docs/PROGRESS.md` 2026-05-24 for the SHAs.
