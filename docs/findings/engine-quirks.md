# Engine quirks

A running collection of small things the original Fortune Summoners
engine does that are weird, charming, or inexplicable.  Each entry is
short — one paragraph or two, optional code snippet, source pointer.

> See `docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` for the convention.  Add an entry whenever

## 1. The bulk of the .exe lives in `.rsrc`, not `.text`

`sotes.exe` is 64 MB on disk, but `.text` is only 1.85 MB.  56 MB is in
`.rsrc` — the PE resource directory.  This is an unusual choice for a
2012-era Windows game; most contemporaries shipped assets in separate
archive files (`.pak`, `.dat`, `.cpr`) and kept the .exe lean.

Lizsoft may have done this to keep all assets in a single tamper-proof
file (the Steam DRM wrap *only* covers the `.text` section; the
resource directory's bytes survive Steamless unmodified, so a comparison
of pre- and post-Steamless sotes.exe is a fast way to confirm where the
asset payload lives).

Possibly relevant: `sotesd.dll` (168 MB) and `sotesw.dll` (82 MB) are
also disproportionately large for code; they may be additional
resource-style asset bundles.  TBD which is which until we look at the
imports of both DLLs and the `LoadLibrary` calls in `sotes.exe`.

> 📍 See `docs/PLAN.md` §4 for the section table.  Confirm by extracting
> .rsrc with `wrestool -x vendor/original/sotes.exe` once we set up an
> extractor.

## 3. The startup launcher is a Win32 dialog with class `#32770`

Before sotes.exe ever reaches `WinMain`'s main-window creation, it pops
a modal Win32 dialog ("Fortune Summoners Ver1.2 - Product Ver. -",
class `#32770` = the standard system dialog class) with:

| ctrlID | text                                     |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 10019  | "Screen Mode" (group label)              |
| 10020  | "Windowed Mode" (radio)                  |
| 10022  | "Fullscreen Mode" (radio)                |
| 10025  | "Zoom Mode(1280x960)" (radio)            |
| 10026  | "Zoom Mode(1920x1440)" (radio)           |
| 10021  | "Graphics Quality" (group label)         |
| 10006  | "High" (radio)                           |
| 10007  | "Medium" (radio)                         |
| 10008  | "Low" (radio)                            |
| 10018  | "VRAM Use" (group label)                 |
| 10015  | "Minimal" (radio)                        |
| 10016  | "Normal Use" (radio)                     |
| 10017  | "Use All" (radio)                        |
| 10023  | (warning text about VRAM + high quality) |
| 10024  | "Disable Sound" (checkbox)               |
| 10003  | "Launch" (button)                        |

Most engines of this era ship a separate `*config.exe` for this; here it's
baked into the main exe and gates the actual game launch.  This means
the harness can't reach any engine code without first dismissing the
dialog — see `tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js`
`installPeriodicWindowScan` for the auto-handler that EnumChildWindows
the dialog, ticks "Disable Sound", and PostMessages `BM_CLICK` to the
Launch button.

The dialog appears even on the Steamless-unpacked exe — it's not part of
the DRM layer.  It's the engine's own first-run-style config dialog,
shown every startup, with selections persisted somewhere (TBD which file).

## 4. Main game window class is `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES`

Once the launcher dialog is dismissed, the engine creates its main game
window with class name `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES` — a Lizsoft-specific class
they apparently use across their products.  Title matches the dialog
("Fortune Summoners Ver1.2 - Product Ver. -") which means a window-
class-only filter (without a title check) would be the safest way to
distinguish "the game window" from "the launcher dialog" in our
harness.

## 2. Steam DRM is SteamStub Variant 2.1 — Steamless unpacks cleanly

The on-disk `sotes.exe` is wrapped with SteamStub Variant 2.1 (the
classic 2011-2013 era variant Lizsoft would have had access to when they
went up on Steam in Jan 2012).  `Steamless.CLI.exe` identifies the
variant on first sight and reconstructs the original entry point and
code section without any manual help: original entry RVA `0x03d0f2ee`
inside the appended `.bind` section becomes `0x004c0a8f` inside `.text`
after unpacking.

The Steam DRM only covers the `.text` section.  Post-Steamless, all
non-code sections (`.rdata`, `.data`, `.rsrc`) byte-match the pre-Steamless
file.

> 📍 `tools/setup.sh` does the detection (objdump section list) +
> unpacking.  See `docs/PROGRESS.md` 2026-05-24 for the SHAs.
