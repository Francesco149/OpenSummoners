engine does that are weird, charming, or inexplicable.  Each entry is
short — one paragraph or two, optional code snippet, source pointer.

## 1. The bulk of the .exe lives in `.rsrc`, not `.text`

`sotes.exe` is 64 MB on disk, but `.text` is only 1.85 MB.  56 MB is in
`.rsrc` — the PE resource directory.  This is an unusual choice for a
2012-era Windows game; most contemporaries shipped assets in separate
archive files (`.pak`, `.dat`, `.cpr`) and kept the .exe lean.

Lizsoft may have done this to keep all assets in a single tamper-proof
file (the Steam DRM wrap *only* covers the `.text` section; the
resource directory's bytes survive Steamless unmodified, so a comparison
of pre- and post-Steamless sotes.exe is a fast way to confirm where the
asset payload lives).

Possibly relevant: `sotesd.dll` (168 MB) and `sotesw.dll` (82 MB) are
also disproportionately large for code; they may be additional
resource-style asset bundles.  TBD which is which until we look at the
imports of both DLLs and the `LoadLibrary` calls in `sotes.exe`.

> 📍 See `docs/PLAN.md` §4 for the section table.  Confirm by extracting
> .rsrc with `wrestool -x vendor/original/sotes.exe` once we set up an
> extractor.

## 3. The startup launcher is a Win32 dialog with class `#32770`

Before sotes.exe ever reaches `WinMain`'s main-window creation, it pops
a modal Win32 dialog ("Fortune Summoners Ver1.2 - Product Ver. -",
class `#32770` = the standard system dialog class) with:

| ctrlID | text                                     |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| 10019  | "Screen Mode" (group label)              |
| 10020  | "Windowed Mode" (radio)                  |
| 10022  | "Fullscreen Mode" (radio)                |
| 10025  | "Zoom Mode(1280x960)" (radio)            |
| 10026  | "Zoom Mode(1920x1440)" (radio)           |
| 10021  | "Graphics Quality" (group label)         |
| 10006  | "High" (radio)                           |
| 10007  | "Medium" (radio)                         |
| 10008  | "Low" (radio)                            |
| 10018  | "VRAM Use" (group label)                 |
| 10015  | "Minimal" (radio)                        |
| 10016  | "Normal Use" (radio)                     |
| 10017  | "Use All" (radio)                        |
| 10023  | (warning text about VRAM + high quality) |
| 10024  | "Disable Sound" (checkbox)               |
| 10003  | "Launch" (button)                        |

Most engines of this era ship a separate `*config.exe` for this; here it's
baked into the main exe and gates the actual game launch.  This means
the harness can't reach any engine code without first dismissing the
dialog — see `tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js`
`installPeriodicWindowScan` for the auto-handler that EnumChildWindows
the dialog, ticks "Disable Sound", and PostMessages `BM_CLICK` to the
Launch button.

The dialog appears even on the Steamless-unpacked exe — it's not part of
the DRM layer.  It's the engine's own first-run-style config dialog,
shown every startup, with selections persisted somewhere (TBD which file).

## 4. Main game window class is `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES`

Once the launcher dialog is dismissed, the engine creates its main game
window with class name `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES` — a Lizsoft-specific class
they apparently use across their products.  Title matches the dialog
("Fortune Summoners Ver1.2 - Product Ver. -") which means a window-
class-only filter (without a title check) would be the safest way to
distinguish "the game window" from "the launcher dialog" in our
harness.

## 2. Steam DRM is SteamStub Variant 2.1 — Steamless unpacks cleanly

The on-disk `sotes.exe` is wrapped with SteamStub Variant 2.1 (the
classic 2011-2013 era variant Lizsoft would have had access to when they
went up on Steam in Jan 2012).  `Steamless.CLI.exe` identifies the
variant on first sight and reconstructs the original entry point and
code section without any manual help: original entry RVA `0x03d0f2ee`
inside the appended `.bind` section becomes `0x004c0a8f` inside `.text`
after unpacking.

The Steam DRM only covers the `.text` section.  Post-Steamless, all
non-code sections (`.rdata`, `.data`, `.rsrc`) byte-match the pre-Steamless
file.

> 📍 `tools/setup.sh` does the detection (objdump section list) +
> unpacking.  See `docs/PROGRESS.md` 2026-05-24 for the SHAs.

## 5. `Zoom Mode(1920x1440)` is in the dialog resource but unconditionally hidden

Control `0x272A` (10026) — "Zoom Mode(1920x1440)" — exists in the launcher
dialog resource (§3 enumerates it) but the DLGPROC calls
`ShowWindow(GetDlgItem(hDlg, 0x272A), SW_HIDE)` on every WM_INITDIALOG.
The scrape path at `0x00401424+` doesn't read its state either.

So Zoom mode in this build means only 1280x960, despite the .rc suggesting
two choices.  Best guess: 1920x1440 was either too expensive on 2012-era
hardware or never finished; the dev took the toggle out of the UX without
ripping the control out of the resource file.

> 📍 See `docs/findings/launcher-dialog.md` for the WM_INITDIALOG flow.

---

## 6. Launcher radio enums start at 3, not 0

Every saved radio in the launcher dialog uses **3 / 4 / 5** as the three
possible enum values; the "Disable Sound" checkbox writes 3 or 4 (not
0/1).  The same +3 offset appears in `config.dat`'s on-disk layout — when
we ship our extractor + writer, we have to faithfully reproduce this
offset.  Looks like the enum was re-numbered at some point and they
didn't rebase to zero.

> 📍 `DAT_008a9b48/4a/4c/4e` in `docs/findings/launcher-dialog.md`.

---

## 7. Three launcher controls are permanently EnableWindow(false)'d

IDs `0x271C / 0x271D / 0x271E` (10012/10013/10014) are greyed out at every
`WM_INITDIALOG` with no path to ever re-enable them.  Visible but
non-interactive in the dialog — probably correspond to abandoned options.

> 📍 `docs/findings/launcher-dialog.md` §"WM_INITDIALOG".

---

## 8. `config.dat` is XOR-obfuscated with a plaintext header

`vendor/original/user/config.dat` (840 bytes) carries a 16-byte plaintext
header followed by 824 bytes of XOR-obfuscated body.  The key byte 0x88
is dead obvious because runs of zero plaintext decode to `88 88 88 88`
sequences in the file, and the file is *full* of them.

```
000000 10 00 00 00 11 27 00 00 34 03 00 00 db 56 00 00
       [hdr=16   ][ver=0x2711][datsz=820][checksum   ]
000010 34 51 bc 3d 8c 88 88 88 f5 05 63 88 8a e3 67 88 …obfuscated…
```

`0x2711` is the `DialogBoxParamA` resource ID for the launcher dialog —
nice cross-confirmation that this file is "the launcher's settings".
Format details TBD; defer to Phase 2's `docs/formats/config-dat.md`
when we write the extractor.

## 9. The "main game window" uses a different WndProc than the "Please wait" window

The engine registers **two** window classes inside `FUN_005a4770`:

- `CLASS_LIZSOFT_WAIT` (reg site `0x5a4ca8`, WndProc `0x401210`) — the
  splash window that paints "Please wait." while the bootstrap runs.
- `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES` (reg site `0x5af314`, WndProc `0x5b12e0`) — the
  actual main game window the player sees.

Both register the same WNDCLASSEX layout (style `CS_HREDRAW|CS_VREDRAW`,
default cursor, no menu) just with different class names + WndProcs.
An earlier read assumed both used `0x401210`; the WAIT one does, but
the main game window's WndProc is `0x5b12e0`, which is what handles
WM_PAINT-for-the-real-game, WM_CLOSE→ExitProcess, WM_ACTIVATEAPP, and
WM_TIMER.

> 📍 See `docs/findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md` "Two WndProcs, two
> classes" section.

---

## 10. The pump only breaks out when `DAT_008a952c != 0` (WM_ACTIVATEAPP flag)

`FUN_005b1030`'s outer spin loop:

```c
while (1) {
    while (PeekMessageA(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE)) { ...dispatch... }
    if (DAT_008a952c != 0 && state->[0x1c] == 0) break;
    WaitMessage();
}
```

`DAT_008a952c` is set by the main-window WndProc on `WM_ACTIVATEAPP`
(see quirk §9).  A hidden window in our harness doesn't naturally
get focus-activated by the OS, so the flag stays 0 and the pump
spins forever the first time the engine calls into it.  The Frida
harness fixes this by `PostMessageA(hwnd, WM_ACTIVATEAPP, TRUE, 0)`
to the main game window as soon as the periodic window scan finds
it.

This is also why early bring-up runs (before this fix) saw
`msg_ticks == 0` even with `--turbo --hide-window`: not that the
engine couldn't pump, but that pump entered, found no activation
flag, and spun.

## 11. `0x01FFFFFF` is the engine's "no color key" sentinel

Throughout the DDraw surface code (`FUN_005b8b40`, `FUN_005b95c0`,
`FUN_005b9830`) the value `0x01FFFFFF` is passed where you'd expect
a color key.  It's a sentinel: `FUN_005b9830` checks
`if (param_1 == 0x01FFFFFF)` and skips the `SetColorKey` call,
storing a flag in `self->[0xd4]` to mark the surface as "no key
attached".

An earlier read of this constant treated it as some kind of
"unlimited / best-fit hint" to DDraw; that was wrong.  It's not
passed to DDraw at all — it's a marker the engine uses internally.

> 📍 `docs/findings/ddraw-init.md` § "FUN_005b9830".

---

## 12. The engine's 24-bit pixelformat case falls through to 32-bit

In `FUN_005b8c00`'s surface-format switch:

```c
switch (bpp) {
  case 8:  ddpf.dwFlags |= DDPF_PALETTEINDEXED8; break;
  case 16: dwRBitMask = 0xF800; dwGBitMask = 0x07E0; dwBBitMask = 0x001F; break;
  case 24:                                   // ← falls through
  case 32: dwRBitMask = 0xFF0000; dwGBitMask = 0xFF00; dwBBitMask = 0xFF; break;
}
```

Case 24 and case 32 share the same masks (XRGB8888 layout) even
though a real 24-bit DDraw surface is packed RGB888 with no padding.
Probably harmless — DDraw ignores `dwRGBBitMasks` for 24/32-bit
surfaces in practice — but our port should faithfully reproduce the
fallthrough to keep the DDSURFACEDESC2 byte-identical for diffing.

> 📍 `docs/findings/ddraw-init.md` § "FUN_005b8c00".

---

## 13. `sotesd.dll` carries a 60-byte hand-rolled signature check

The first thing `FUN_005a4770` does after `LoadLibraryA("sotesd.dll")`
is verify that resource ID `0x7DE` (2014) contains a recognizable
60-byte ASCII signature.  Each byte in `sotesd.dll`'s resource (at
offsets 60..119) is treated as an index into `A..Z` by adding `0x41`,
producing a 60-character string compared against the engine's
hardcoded constant:

```
JFDGGIUABCVJIEKAUYLPOFDEQBVGSKOLJSCKPIFAXMHGYELSDOBFRKVGBAKB
```

If the comparison fails the engine logs `"Necessary resource (B) is
not found."` and `ExitProcess(0)`.  Looks like a manual integrity
seal — the author typed a random key once, baked it into both the
engine and the data DLL, and shipped them together.

Implication for the drop-in port: we must either reproduce the
identical check (and refuse to run if the user's sotesd.dll has been
tampered with) or just no-op it.  No-op is the cleaner choice — the
check serves no purpose in a behavior-fidelity port that links
against the user's own legit sotesd.dll.

> 📍 `docs/findings/asset-loader.md` § "sotesd.dll signature check".

## 14. PE has 1768 Ghidra-recovered functions but several "load-bearing" ones are reached only via function pointer

Ghidra's auto-analysis misses functions that are never the target of a
direct call — common when the engine uses C++-style vtables or stores
callbacks in globals.  Confirmed misses so far:

- `0x4013c0` — launcher DLGPROC (passed to `DialogBoxParamA`)
- `0x401210` — `CLASS_LIZSOFT_WAIT` WndProc (stored in WNDCLASSEX)
- `0x401730` — VRAM-group enable helper (called from the missed DLGPROC)
- `0x5b12e0` — `CLASS_LIZSOFT_SOTES` WndProc — actually Ghidra DID pick
  this up (decompiled output exists) but it has no callers; only
  reachable via a stored function pointer in the second WNDCLASSEX.

Workflow: when grepping Ghidra output for callers of a callback type
(WndProc, DLGPROC, vtable entry) and getting zero hits, fall back to
radare2 (`af @ <addr>; pdf`) on the address you find by scanning for
the function-pointer write site, not by Ghidra's call graph.

> 📍 Pattern documented under `docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` (Reading the
> decompiled output) — radare2 is the second-line tool.
