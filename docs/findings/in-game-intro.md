# In-game intro — the scene past the prologue (map 0x3f2)

Milestone 2 (the game proper).  The user opted to **extend the trace in-game**
(ckpt 48): spam Z after the prologue begins, capture ~1 min of retail frames,
then port to match.  This doc is the living plan + engine survey.

**Status (ckpt 50):** the foundational plumbing is in place — the **game-entry
anchor** (both sides) and the **port seam** (`PROLOGUE_DONE → enter_game`).  The
in-game **engine** (`0x59f2c0` + its two giant children) is surveyed but
**unported** — that is the multi-checkpoint body of milestone 2.

## How you reach it (the Z-spam exit)

The prologue cutscene `0x56cd20` exits on the **3rd "beat"** — any fresh key
press (`prologue_stone`: `beats++`, 3rd → exit fade → ~200-tick watchdog →
`PROLOGUE_DONE`).  **Z = the confirm id `0x24` (36)** = a beat (the NORMAL exit);
`0x22` would *abort* to the title instead.  On `PROLOGUE_DONE` retail's boot
driver calls **`0x59ec30(0, 0, 0x3f2)`** (app_flow.c chain: `0x1a → 0x564160 …
0x56cd20 … 0x59ec30(0,0,0x3f2)`), which loads + runs the opening map.

Trace (RETAIL flips, lockstep): Start@615 → down@715/740 → confirm@795 → fade →
prologue_enter@815 → Z beats @850/870/890/910/930 → exit → in-game.  Then Z every
20 flips advances the story dialogue.  Saved: `tests/scenarios/in-game-intro/`.

## The RETAIL golden (runs/tas-ingame-1 — local only, runs/ is gitignored)

Captured under `--lockstep` (240 s, 250 events; anchors subtitle@432 /
newgame@667 / prologue@815, consistent with all prior runs).  Frame-content
sweep (mean brightness / distinct colors):

| flip | content |
|------|---------|
| 900–1050 | **black** (cutscene exit-fade + the post-3rd-beat watchdog + map load) |
| 1100 | transition begins (mean 0.7, 99 colors) |
| **1150** | **first in-game frame — the opening TOWN of Tilelia** (houses, NPCs, hill backdrop, a banner across the top) |
| 1200–1700 | the town scene (mean ~70, 2–5k colors) |
| ~2200–2500 | **story DIALOGUE** — a character portrait (the girl) + an empty dialogue box; Z advances it |
| 3000 | dialogue continues |

So the in-game intro is: **opening town map → intro story dialogue** (Z-advanced).
Montage pushed to llm-feed (frames 1150/1200/1400/1800/2200/2500).

**The game proper renders from ~flip 1150** (retail).  900–1100 is black (the
fade-out + the map resource load — `0x59ec30` logs `"Unload Resource From…
Terminate"` between scenes and loads the new map's banks).

## Plumbing (DONE, ckpt 50)

### Game-entry anchor — both sides
- **Retail:** `SCENE_ANCHORS` in `tools/frida/opensummoners-agent.js` gains
  `{ va: 0x59f2c0, name: 'game_enter' }`.  `0x59f2c0(map,…)` is the per-map run
  loop the wrapper `0x59ec30` calls — once for the first map 0x3f2, again per map
  transition (0x2724/0x272e).  It fires on EVERY entry; the flip stamp
  disambiguates re-entries.  The cutscene exit-fade + map load make the
  commit→first-game-frame flip offset variable, so a map-loop-entry anchor is
  required (a fixed offset off prologue_enter would NOT hold).
- **Port:** `enter_game()` in `src/main.c` emits `emit_anchor("game_enter")`
  (logs `anchor: game_enter flip=<N> rng=0x<hex>`), matching the retail name so
  `tas_diff` can align the in-game frames once they render.

### Port seam — PROLOGUE_DONE → enter_game
`main_loop_body`'s prologue arm now routes the NORMAL exit (3rd beat →
`PROLOGUE_DONE`) to **`enter_game()`** instead of `leave_prologue_to_title`.
`enter_game` tears down the prologue drive, emits the anchor, logs the seam
(`enter_game: 0x59ec30(0,0,0x3f2) — opening map (in-game engine 0x59f2c0
unported)`), and — since the engine is unported — re-displays the title (like
the other unported sub-scene stubs: DEMO_START etc.).  **The ABORT path (id
0x22) still goes to `leave_prologue_to_title`.**  When `0x59f2c0` is ported,
`enter_game`'s body becomes a real `game_drive` init/step loop.

## Entry-function map (the milestone-2 units)

```
0x59ec30(p1, p2, map=0x3f2)   — scene LOAD/UNLOAD WRAPPER (531 B)
  do {                            (outer loop over map (re)loads)
    *in_ECX = operator_new(0x18)  — the scene object (fields [0..5])
    result  = 0x59f2c0(map, p2, …, &local_18, …)   ← THE ENGINE (3522 B)
    unload the scene object's resources
      (0x5a4320 / 0x5bef0e ×3 / 0x43e3a0(2) / 0x5a4440;
       OutputDebugStringA "Unload Resource From… Terminate")
    if result==4||5:  next = 0x59ee50(local_18, …)
                      0x16 → reload map 0x2724,  0x17 → reload map 0x272e
    else:             teardown (free local_14 list, local_10 block) + return
  } while (true)
```

`0x59f2c0(map,…)` — the IN-GAME ENGINE (3522 B): **allocates the world, loads
the map, runs the per-room loop.**  Decomposition:

1. **Zero a ~0xeb1c-B stack scratch frame** (`0x59f2c0:44-87`): a 0x29-dword
   header, a 0x800-dword tilemap, **8× (0x47-dword + 0x108-dword) entity blocks**
   (the party/actor scratch), a 0x600-dword block, a 0x1800-dword block, a final
   0x800-dword block.  These are the per-room working buffers.
2. **Allocate the world objects:**
   - `pvVar1 = operator_new(0x4120)` — the **map object** (the big one).  Its
     `+0x4030..+0x404c` get **8× `operator_new(0xeec)`** sub-objects (per-actor
     state).  The **map-id field is `+0x4104`** — defaults to **`0x3f2`** when
     the caller passes 0 (`0x59f2c0:378-381`).  `+0x4068` = a `GetTickCount`
     stamp (the in-game pace clock).
   - `scene[4] = operator_new(0x5400c)` — a large world buffer (tile/cell data;
     ~1014× 0x54-dword entries).
   - `scene[5] = operator_new(0x7808)` — a second large world buffer.
   - `scene[1..3] = operator_new(0x88)` ×3 — three small sub-objects.
3. **Init the actor/cell registry** (`0x59f2c0:122-144`): copy the global table
   **`&DAT_006940c8`** (0x54-dword stride, zero-terminated) into `scene[4]`
   entry-by-entry, calling **`0x585000`** (413 B) per entry.  `scene[4]` head =
   `&DAT_00693848`.  This is the static map/tile-type or actor-type manifest.
4. **Two init arms** keyed on `in_stack_0000eb2c` (the second scene param):
   - `== 0` (the **fresh new-game entry — our path**): init the 8 actor slots
     via `0x560e60`, set map-object header fields (`+0x4018/+0x4054=3/+0x4064…`),
     stamp `+0x4068 = GetTickCount`, set `+0x4104 = map id`, then `0x4c5350` /
     `0x4e59a0` → fall into the room loop at `LAB_0059fb8a`.
   - `!= 0` (a **save/continue load**): `0x5b6060`/`0x41cfd0` + the save-buffer
     path (`0x5b6200`/`0x5b6300`… — the resource-0x2711 save reader, the same
     subsystem `newgame_start_save_salt` salts) then the same room-loop entry.
5. **The per-room loop** (`LAB_0059fb8a` → `LAB_0059fd85`):
   - `0x5611d0` / `0x5851e0` / `0x59e1a0` — room setup.
   - `local_8 = 0x561c90()` — fetch the active room/scene record; NULL → exit.
   - `0x560e90()` — room step.
   - `0x586010()` → **the per-step driver** (see below); its return code
     `local_c` selects: **1/2/3/0xa → `0x4e61a0`** (continue), **4/5** → a scene
     transition (`0x5a3bf0`/`0x5a3c10`/`0x4e1950` + a 58000-B alloc room rebuild,
     sets `*scene_done=1`), **default** → exit.
   - then a SECOND switch on `puVar13`: **3 → `switchD_caseD_3`** which calls
     **`0x5a00c0()`** = **the in-game RENDER dispatch**; `0x5a00c0` returning 6
     exits, else loop back to `LAB_0059fd85`.  **1/2/0xa → loop** (re-step
     without render).  So the loop is *render-on-demand*: `0x586010` steps the
     sim and only state 3 triggers a `0x5a00c0` present.
```

### The two giant children (the real milestone-2 body)
- **`0x586010` (6133 B) — the per-step driver.**  Allocates the global
  room-state object **`DAT_008a9b50 = operator_new(0x27b8)`** (`0x4017d0` ctor),
  wires the scene pointers into it (`+0x1044=scene`, `+0x103c/+0x1038` = the
  caption/param ptrs), references the string **`"Start StartArea"`**
  (`s_Start_StartArea_008a2dd0` → `&DAT_008a9b6c`, the start-room name).  Per
  `docs/findings/0057ca40-rabbit-hole.md` §6 it also drives **palette/sprite
  rendering** off the info-entry pool (`DAT_008a866c` = pool index 61, fields
  +4/+8/+0xc).  Net: this is the room **state-setup + simulation/draw step** that
  returns the loop's dispatch code.  Hybrid load+update — port it as a unit, but
  expect to stub large arms first.
- **`0x5a00c0` (13690 B) — the in-game RENDER dispatch.**  Walks the world and
  blits tiles/entities/UI.  **Reuses the already-ported sprite primitives:**
  `ar_sprite_decode` (`0x4184a0`), the zdd blits (`0x5b9b70`/`0x5b9410`/…), the
  alpha ramp leaf (`0x5bd550`), and the pace pump (`0x5b1030`).  It is recursive
  (calls itself — a scene-tree walk).  This is where the town tilemap + NPCs +
  banner + dialogue box are drawn → **the smallest visible win lives here**, on
  top of primitives the port already has.

## Porting plan (the same loop as title/new-game/prologue)

1. ~~**A game-entry ANCHOR**~~ **DONE (ckpt 50)** — retail `0x59f2c0` +
   port `enter_game` emit `game_enter`.
2. ~~**Wire the port seam**~~ **DONE (ckpt 50)** — `PROLOGUE_DONE → enter_game`.
3. **Survey + port `0x59f2c0`** in units, port-and-test each vs the golden,
   smallest visible win first:
   - **(a) The map-0x3f2 resource/bank load.**  OPEN QUESTION: which DLL banks +
     the load path.  Likely needs the deferred `ar_register_*` batches (the
     in-game sprite/tile banks) registered at boot — the way the title banks were
     at ckpt 26 (`init_sprite_banks` → `ar_register_main_sprites`).  Find where
     `0x586010` / `0x5a3c40` (the 0x910-alloc room record) loads map 0x3f2's
     tile/sprite resources, and which sotes*.dll holds them.
   - **(b) The static town backdrop/tilemap render.**  Stand up a `game_drive`
     (mirror `prologue_drive`): hold the map object + scene, step once/frame,
     render via a ported slice of `0x5a00c0`, present.  Target the static
     tilemap + backdrop FIRST (flip ~1150 golden), diff vs `runs/tas-ingame-1`.
   - **(c) Entities/NPCs**, then **(d) the dialogue box** (portrait + textbox,
     ~flip 2200 — likely the glyph pipeline again).
4. **Diff** each ported piece vs `runs/tas-ingame-1` at the matching tick
   (anchor on `game_enter`).

## Open questions for the port

- **The map-0x3f2 resource set** (plan 3a): which DLL banks + the load path
  (`0x586010`/`0x5a3c40`) — almost certainly needs the in-game sprite/tile banks
  registered at boot, like the title banks (ckpt 26).
- **`0x586010`'s true split** load-vs-draw: it both allocates `DAT_008a9b50`
  (looks once-per-room) yet is called every loop iteration — confirm whether the
  alloc/teardown is guarded (it frees `DAT_008a9b50` at the top if non-NULL,
  `586010:97-102`), i.e. it re-creates the room-state each step, or the loop only
  re-enters on room change.  Trace the loop cadence live (a `0x586010` entry hook
  + flip stamp) to pin whether the engine loop is per-frame or per-room.
- **The dialogue system** (portrait + textbox + the story script for map 0x3f2)
  — a sub-system of the map loop; the text is likely the glyph pipeline again.
- **Whether the intro is scripted** (an event track auto-advanced by Z) or free
  movement — the golden shows a banner + dialogue, suggesting a scripted intro.
